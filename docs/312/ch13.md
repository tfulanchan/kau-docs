## 13.1 Who is Attacking Our Network?

Attackers wants to access our assets such as data and other intellectual property, servers, computers, smart phones, tablets, and so on.

### Threat, Vulnerability, and Risk 

| Term | Explaination |
|-|-|
| Threat | A potential danger to an asset such as data or the network itself. |
| Vulnerability | A weakness in a system or its design that could be exploited by a threat.
| Attack Surface | An attack surface is the total sum of the vulnerabilities in a given system that are accessible to an attacker. The attack surface describes different points where an attacker could get into a system, and where they could get data out of the system. |
| Exploit | The mechanism that is used to leverage a vulnerability to compromise an asset. Exploits may be remote or local. <ul><li>A remote exploit is one that works over the network without any prior access to the target system.</li><li>In a local exploit, the threat actor has some type of user or administrative access to the end system. It does not necessarily mean that the attacker has physical access to the end system.</li></ul> |
| Asset | The organizational resource that is being protected.
| Risk | The likelihood that a particular threat will exploit a particular vulnerability of an asset and result in an undesirable consequence. |

Risk management is the process that balances the operational costs of providing protective measures with the gains achieved by protecting the asset. 

Four ways to manage risk:

| Risk Management Strategy | Explanation |
|-|-|
| Risk acceptance | When the cost of risk management options outweighs the cost of risk, the risk is accepted, and no action is taken. |
| Risk avoidance | This means avoiding any exposure to risk by eliminating the activity, thus resulting in losing any benefits from the activity. |
| Risk reduction | This reduces the exposure to risk. It is the most commonly used risk mitigation strategy. This strategy requires careful evaluation of the costs of loss, the mitigation strategy, and the benefits gained from the operation or activity that is at risk. |
| Risk transfer | Some or all of the risk is transferred to a willing third party such as insurance company or outsourcing. |

Common network security terms:
+ Countermeasure/security control – Actions taken to protect assets by mitigating a threat or reducing risk.
+ Impact - The potential damage to the organization that is caused by the threat

### Hacker vs. Threat Actor

'Hacker' is a common term used to describe a threat actor. Hacker has a variety of meanings that are as follows:
+ A clever programmer capable of developing new programs and making coding changes to existing programs to make them more efficient.
+ A network professional that uses sophisticated programming skills to ensure that networks are not vulnerable to attack.
+ An individual who run programs to prevent or corrupt data on servers.

Types of hackers:
+ White Hat hackers
+ Gray Hat hackers
+ Black Hat hackers

White Hat Hackers: White hat hackers are ethical hackers who use their programming skills for good, ethical, and legal purposes.

Gray Hat Hackers: Gray hat hackers are individuals who commit crimes and unethical things, but not for personal gain or to cause damage.

Black Hat Hackers: Black hat hackers are unethical criminals who violate computer and network security for personal gain.

The term ‘threat actor’ is used when referring to individuals or groups that could be classified as gray or black hat hackers.

Types of Threat Actors:
+ **Script kiddies** - It refers to teenagers or inexperienced threat actors running existing scripts, tools, and exploits, to cause harm, but typically not for profit. Also called Amateur.
+ **Vulnerability brokers** - It refers to gray hat hackers who attempt to discover exploits and report them to vendors, for prizes or rewards.
+ **Hacktivists** - It refers to gray hat hackers who rally and protest against different political and social ideas. 
+ **Cybercriminals** -  It refers to black hat hackers who are either self-employed or working for large cybercrime organizations. 
+ **State-sponsored** - State-Sponsored hackers are threat actors who steal government secrets, gather intelligence, and sabotage networks of foreign governments, terrorist groups, and corporations.

Cybercriminals are threat actors who are motivated to make money using any necessary means. 
At times, cybercriminals work independently or they are financed and sponsored by criminal organizations.  They steal billions of dollars from consumers and businesses every year. They operate in underground economy and buy and sell personal information and intellectual property that they steal from victims. They target small businesses and consumers, as well as large enterprises and industries.

Threat actors target the home users, small-to-medium sized businesses, as well as large public and private organizations. Hence, Cybersecurity is a shared responsibility which all users must practice to make the internet and networks safer and more secure. Organizations must take action and protect their assets, users, and customers. They must develop and practice cybersecurity tasks such as those mentioned in the figure. Security awareness and improve the culture of security is also essential.

### Cyber Threat Indicators

Indicators Of Compromise are the evidence that an attack has occurred and each attack has unique identifiable attributes. Indicators Of Compromise can be features that identify malware files, IP addresses of servers that are used in attacks, filenames, and characteristic changes made to end system software, among others. Indicators Of Compromise help cybersecurity personnel identify what has happened in an attack and develop defenses against the attack. 

Indicators of Attack focus more on the motivation and strategies behind an attack and the attackers to gain access to assets. Indicators of Attacks helps to generate a proactive security approach that can be reused in multiple contexts and multiple attacks. Defending against a strategy can therefore prevent future attacks.

### Who is in charge of security in KSA?

The government of Saudi Arabia has established the National Cybersecurity Authority (NCA) to be the government entity in charge of cybersecurity in the country, and it serves as the national authority on its affairs. The NCA was established in 2017 by a Royal Order that links it directly to HM the King. The NCA has both regulatory and operational functions related to cybersecurity and it works closely with public and private entities to improve the cybersecurity posture of the country in order to safeguard its vital interests, national security, critical infrastructures, high-priority sectors, and government services and activities in alignment with Vision 2030.

## 13.2 Threat Actor Tools

### Introduction to Attack Tools

To exploit vulnerability, a threat actor must have a technique or tool. Over the years, attack tools have become more sophisticated, and highly automated. These new tools require less technical knowledge to implement. Recent tools are more sophisticated at the same time they require less technical knowledge to implement.

Ethical hacking involves using many different types of tools to test the network and end devices. To validate the security of a network and its systems, many network penetration testing tools have been developed and many of these tools can also be used by threat actors for exploitation. Threat actors have also created various hacking tools. Cybersecurity personnel must also know how to use these tools when performing network penetration tests.

Categories of common network penetration testing tools:

| Categories of Tools | Description |-|
|-|-|-|
| Password crackers | Used to crack or recover the password. | John the Ripper, Ophcrack |
| Wireless hacking tools | Used to intentionally hack into a wireless network to detect security vulnerabilities. | Aircrack-ng, Kismet |
| Network scanning and hacking tools | Used to probe network devices, servers, and hosts for open TCP or UDP ports.  | Nmap, SuperScan |
| Packet crafting tools | Used to probe and test a firewall’s robustness.  | Hping, Scapy
| Packet sniffers | Used to capture and analyze packets within traditional Ethernet LANs or WLANs.  | Wireshark, Tcpdump |
| Rootkit detectors | It is a directory and file integrity checker used by white hats to detect installed root kits.  | AIDE, Netfilter |
| Fuzzers to search vulnerabilities | Used by threat actors when attempting to discover a computer system’s security vulnerabilities.  | Skipfish, Wapiti |
| Forensic tools | White hat hackers use these tools to sniff out any trace of evidence existing in a particular computer system.  | Sleuth Kit, Helix |
| Debuggers | Used by black hats to reverse engineer binary files when writing exploits and used by white hats when analyzing malware. | GDB, WinDbg |
| Hacking operating systems | These are preloaded with tools and technologies optimized for hacking.  | Kali Linux, SELinux |
| Encryption tools | These tools use algorithm schemes to encode the data to prevent unauthorized access to the data.  | VeraCrypt, CipherShed |
| Vulnerability exploitation tools | These tools identify whether a remote host is vulnerable to a security attack.  | Metasploit, Core Impact |
| Vulnerability scanners | These tools scan a network or system to identify open ports. They can also be used to scan for known vulnerabilities and scan VMs, BYOD devices, and client databases. | Nipper, Securia PSI |

### Categories of Attacks

| Category of Attack | Description |
|-|-|
| Eavesdropping attack | An eavesdropping attack is when a threat actor captures and listens to network traffic. This is also called as sniffing or snooping. |
| Data modification attack | Data modification attacks occur when a threat actor has captured enterprise traffic and has altered the data in the packets without the knowledge of the sender or receiver. |
| IP address spoofing attack | An IP address spoofing attack is when a threat actor constructs an IP packet that appears to originate from a valid address inside the corporate intranet. |
| Password-based attacks | Password-based attacks occur when a threat actor obtains the credentials for a valid user account. |
| Denial-of-service attack | A Denial-of-service attack prevents normal use of a computer or network by valid users. This attack can block traffic, which results in a loss of access to network resources. |
| Man-in-the-middle attack | A Man-in-the-middle attack attack occurs when threat actors have positioned themselves between a source and destination. |
| Compromised key attack | A compromised-key attack occurs when a threat actor obtains a secret key. A compromised key can be used to gain access to a secured communication without the sender or receiver. |
| Sniffer attack | A sniffer is an application or device that can read, monitor, and capture network data exchanges and read network packets. If the packets are not encrypted, a sniffer provides a full view of the data inside the packet. |
