## 14.1 Malware

Malware is a code or software designed to damage, disrupt, steal, or inflict some other ‘bad’ or illegitimate action on data, hosts, or networks. The three most common types of malware are Virus, Worm, and Trojan horse.

The following video explains different types of malware.

### Virus

A virus is a type of malware that spreads by inserting a copy of itself into another program. After the program is run, viruses spread from one computer to another, thus infecting the computers. A simple virus may install itself at the first line of code in an executable file. 

Viruses can be harmless, such as those that display a picture on the screen, or they can be destructive. They can also modify or delete files on the hard drive. Most viruses spread by USB memory drives, CDs, DVDs, network shares, and email. Email viruses are a common type of virus.

### Trojan horse

Trojan horse malware is a software that appears to be legitimate, but contains malicious code which exploits the privileges of the user that runs it. Trojans are found attached to online games.

Users are commonly tricked into loading and executing the Trojan horse on their systems. The Trojan horse concept is flexible.  It can cause immediate damage, provide remote access to the system, or access through a back door. Custom-written Trojan horses with a specific target are difficult to detect. Trojan horses are usually classified according to the damage that they cause, or the manner in which they breach a system.

### Worms

Computer worms are similar to viruses because they replicate themselves by independently exploiting vulnerabilities in networks. Worms can slow down networks as they spread from system to system. Worms can run without a host program. However, once the host is infected, the worm spreads rapidly over the network. In 2001, the Code Red worm had initially infected 658 servers. Within 19 hours, the worm had infected over 300,000 servers.

The initial infection of the SQL Slammer worm is known as the worm that ate the internet. SQL Slammer was a Denial of Service (DoS) attack that exploited a buffer overflow bug in Microsoft’s SQL Server. The number of infected servers doubled in size every 8.5 seconds. The infected servers did not have the updated patch that was released 6 months earlier. Hence it is essential for organizations to implement a security policy requiring updates and patches to be applied in a timely fashion.

The three worm components are as follows:
+ **Enabling vulnerability** - A worm installs itself using an exploit mechanism, such as an email attachment, an executable file, or a Trojan horse, on a vulnerable system.
+ **Propagation mechanism** - After gaining access to a device, the worm replicates itself and locates new targets.
+ **Payload** - Any malicious code that results in some action is a payload. Most often this is used to create a backdoor that allows a threat actor to access the infected host or to create a DoS attack.

### Components of Worms

Worms are self-contained programs that attack a system to exploit a known vulnerability.
They reside in active memory and duplicate themselves. Upon successful exploitation, the worm copies itself from the attacking host to the newly exploited system and the cycle begins again. This propagation mechanism is commonly deployed in a way that is difficult to detect.

Worms never stop spreading on the internet. After they are released, worms continue to propagate until all possible sources of infection are properly patched.

### Ransomware

Ransomware is a malware that denies access to the infected computer system or its data. Ransomware frequently uses an encryption algorithm to encrypt system files and data. Email and malicious advertising, also known as malvertising, are vectors for ransomware campaigns. Social engineering is also used, when cybercriminals pretending to be security technicians make random calls at homes and persuade users to connect to a website that downloads ransomware to the user’s computer.

### Common Malware Behaviors

Computers infected with malware often exhibit one or more of the following symptoms:
+ Appearance of strange files, programs, or desktop icons
+ Antivirus and firewall programs are turning off or reconfiguring settings
+ Computer screen is freezing or system is crashing
+ Emails are spontaneously being sent without your knowledge to your contact list
+ Files have been modified or deleted
+ Increased CPU and/or memory usage
+ Problems connecting to networks
+ Slow computer or web browser speeds
+ Unknown processes or services running
+ Unknown TCP or UDP ports open
+ Connections are made to hosts on the Internet without user action
+ Strange computer behavior

## 14.2 Common Network Attacks - Reconnaissance, Access, and Social Engineering

### Types of Network Attacks

Malware is a means to get a payload delivered. When a payload is delivered and installed, it can be used to cause a variety of network-related attacks from the inside as well as from the outside.

Network attacks are classified into three categories:
+ Reconnaissance Attacks
+ Access Attacks
+ Denial of Services Attacks

Reconnaissance is information gathering.

Threat actors use reconnaissance (or recon) attacks to do unauthorized discovery and mapping of systems, services, or vulnerabilities.

Reconnaissance attacks precede access attacks or DoS attacks.

### Access Attacks

|-|-|
|-|-|
| Access attacks | exploit known vulnerabilities in authentication services, FTP services, and web services to gain entry into web accounts, confidential databases, and other sensitive information. |
| Password Attacks | The threat actor attempts to discover critical system passwords using a variety of password cracking tools. |
| Spoofing Attacks | The threat actor device attempts to pose as another device by falsifying data. |

Common spoofing attacks include IP spoofing, MAC spoofing, and DHCP spoofing.

+ Trust exploitations
+ Port redirections
+ Man-in-the-middle attacks
+ Buffer overflow attacks

Trust Exploitation: A hacker uses unauthorized privileges to gain access to a system, possibly compromising the target. For example, if a DMZ device has access to the inside network, an attacker could leverage that by gaining access to the DMZ device and using that location to launch his attacks from there to the inside network.

Port Redirection: A hacker uses a compromised system as a base for attacks against other targets

Man-in-the-Middle Attack: An attacker places himself in line between two legitimate devices that are communicating, with the intent to perform reconnaissance or to manipulate the data as it moves between them. This can happen at Layer 2 or Layer 3. The main purpose is eavesdropping, so the attacker can see all the traffic.

Buffer Overflow Attack: An attacker exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability, which is a programming flaw. If a service accepts input and expects the input to be within a certain size but does not verify the size of input upon reception, it may be vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. This means that an attacker can provide input that is larger than expected, and the service will accept the input and write it to memory, filling up the associated buffer and also overwriting adjacent memory. This overwrite may corrupt the system and cause it to crash, resulting in a DoS. In the worst cases, the attacker can inject malicious code, leading to a system compromise.

### Social Engineering

Social Engineering is an access attack that attempts to manipulate individuals into performing actions or divulging into confidential information. Some social engineering techniques are performed in-person or via the telephone or internet. Social engineering techniques are explained in the table below.

The Social Engineer Toolkit was designed to help white hat hackers and other network security professionals to create social engineering attacks to test their own networks.

Enterprises must educate their users about the risks of social engineering, and develop strategies to validate identities over the phone, via email, or in person.

Cybersecurity is as strong as its weakest link. The weakest link in cybersecurity can be the personnel within an organization, and social engineering is a major security threat. One of the most effective security measures that an organization can take is to train its personnel and create a ‘security-aware culture’.

## 14.3 Network Attacks - Denial of Service, Buffer Overflows, and Evasion

**DoS Attack**: attempts to consume all of the resources of a critical computer or network in order to make it unavailable for valid use. A DoS attack typically results in some sort of interruption of service to users, devices, or applications.

**DDoS Attack**: Malicious hosts can also coordinate to flood a victim with an abundance of attack packets, so that the attack takes place simultaneously from potentially thousands of sources. This type of attack is called a DDoS attack. DDoS attacks typically emanate from networks of compromised systems, known as botnets.

A Denial of Service (DoS) attack creates some sort of interruption in network services to users, devices, or applications. The two types of DoS attacks are as follows:
+ Overwhelming Quantity of Traffic - The threat actor sends an enormous quantity of data at a rate that the network, host, or application cannot handle. 
+ Maliciously Formatted Packets - The threat actor sends a maliciously formatted packet to a host or application and the receiver is unable to handle it.

Mirai is a malware that targeted IoT devices configured with default login information. The botnet was used as part of a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.

### Buffer Overflow Attack

The threat actor uses the buffer overflow DoS attack to find a system memory-related flaw on a server and exploit it. For instance, a remote denial of service attack vulnerability was discovered in Microsoft Windows 10, where the threat actor created malicious code to access out-of-scope memory. Another example is ping of death, where a threat actor sends a ping of death, which is an echo request in an IP packet that is larger than the maximum packet size. The receiving host cannot handle a packet size and it would crash. It is estimated that one third of malicious attacks are the result of buffer overflows.

### Evasion Methods

## 14.4 Common Threats and Attacks Summary

Malware is short for malicious software or malicious code.

Most viruses are spread through USB memory drives, CDs, DVDs, network shares, and email.

Trojans are found in online games.  

Three common types of malware are virus, worm, and Trojan horse.

Threat actors can also attack the network from outside.

The three major categories are reconnaissance, access, and DoS attacks.

Recon attacks precede access or DoS attacks.

Access attacks exploit known vulnerabilities in authentication services, FTP services, and web services. 
DoS attacks create some sort of interruption of network services to users, devices, or applications.

DDoS attacks are similar in intent to DoS attacks, except that the DDoS attack increases in magnitude because it originates from multiple, coordinated sources.

Mirai is a malware that targets IoT devices configured with default login information.

The goal of a threat actor when using a buffer overflow DoS attack is to find a system memory-related flaw on a server and exploit it.
