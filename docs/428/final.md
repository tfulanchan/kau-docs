Freedom of speech does not protect:

Perjury and fraud

Defamation and obscene speech

Incitement of panic and incitement to crime

Fighting words and sedition

The right to freedom of expression is restricted when the expressions, whether spoken or written, are untrue and cause harm to another person.

Defamation is the act of communicating false statements about a person that injure the reputation of that person

Doxing: is the process of examining the Internet records in order to reveal the identity of an anonymous poster

Sexting: Sending sexual messages, nude or seminude photos, or sexually explicit videos over a cell phone

Pornography is the depiction of erotic behavior (as in pictures or writing) intended to cause sexual excitement.

------------

Patent: Grant of a property right issued by the governments to an inventor

Prevent independent creation and copying

Require filing application

Software patents

Protects feature, function, or process embodied in instructions executed on a computer

Reverse engineering: Process of taking something apart in order to understand it, build a copy of it, or improve it

Open source: Program whose source code is made available for use or modification, as users or other developers see fit

Industrial espionage: Use of illegal means to obtain business information not available to the general public

Cybersquatters: Register domain names for famous trademarks or company names to which they had no connection

Software defect is any error that, if not removed, could cause a software system to fail to meet its users’ needs.

Software quality is the degree to which a software product meets the needs of its users. 

Quality management focuses on defining, measuring, and refining the quality of the development process and the products developed during its various stages.

Strict liability means that the defendant is held responsible for injuring another person, regardless of negligence or intent.

Doctrine of supervening event: the original seller is not liable if the software was materially altered after it left the seller’s possession and the alteration caused the injury

Negligence - Failure to do what a reasonable person would do, or doing something that a reasonable person would not do

Contracts written expressly to limit claims of supplier negligence may be disregarded by the courts as unreasonable.

Contributory negligence: Plaintiffs’ own actions contributes to their injuries

A warranty assures buyers or lessees that a product meets certain standards of quality.

Breach of warranty: buyer can sue the seller if the product fails to meet the terms of its warranty

Misrepresentation occurs when a seller or lessor either misrepresents the quality of a product or conceals a defect in it

Quality assurance refers to methods within the development cycle designed to guarantee reliable operation of a product. Ideally, these methods are applied at each stage of the development cycle. 

Dynamic testing: Entering test data and comparing the results with the expected results in a process

Black-box testing: Viewing the software unit as a device that has expected input and output behaviors but whose internal workings are unknown

White-box testing: Treats the software unit as a device that has expected input and output behaviors but whose internal workings are known

Static testing: Special software programs called static analyzers are run against new code. Rather than reviewing input and output, the static analyzer looks for suspicious patterns in programs that might 
indicate a defect.

Integration testing: After successful unit testing, the software units are combined into an integrated subsystem that undergoes rigorous testing to ensure that the linkages among the various subsystems work 
successfully.

Risk is the probability of an undesirable event occurring (likelihood) times the probability that the event would go undetected (detectability) times the magnitude of the event’s consequences if it does happen 
(impact).

N-version programming: Approach to minimize the impact of software errors by independently implementing the same set of user requirements N times

Failures are classified according to their impact on a project’s success, personnel safety, equipment safety, customer satisfaction, and customer safety.

A failure mode describes how a product or process could fail to perform the desired functions described by the customer.

National GDP represents the total annual output of a nation’s economy. 

GDP rate of change varies as a result of business cycles that affect prices, wages, employment levels, and the production of goods and services. 

The standard of living varies greatly among groups within a country as well as from nation to nation. 

Labor productivity measures the amount of goods and services produced by one hour of labor

the need to cut costs, improve efficiency, and encourage greater collaboration among employees

The digital divide is a term used to describe the gulf between those who do and those who don’t have access to modern information and communications technology

Cyberstalking: Threatening behavior or unwanted advances directed at an adult using the Internet or other forms of online and electronic communications

Social networking Web sites have policies against uploading videos depict violence or obscenity

Most social networking Web sites have terms of use agreements that give the sites the right to delete material and terminate users accounts that violate their policy

Most Web sites do not have sufficient resources to review all material posted

An online virtual world is a shared multimedia, computer-generated environment in which users, represented by avatars, can act, communicate, create, retain ownership of what they create, and exchange 
assets, including currency, with each other.
