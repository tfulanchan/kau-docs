Kaiser Permanente is a unique integrated health care system that combines health coverage and care delivery into one coordinated experience. Kaiser Permanente's business strategy focuses on providing high-quality, affordable health care services and improving the health of its members and communities. Under the previous "fix me" system, bonuses to doctors were based on the volume of services provided. However, Kaiser Permanente has shifted to a new model where end-of-year bonuses are based on quality metrics and patient outcomes. This change in incentive structure, along with Kaiser Permanente's integrated model that aligns the goals of the health plan and medical groups, has been key to its success. Kaiser Permanente's integrated model includes components such as electronic health records, telehealth, and population health management. While changing the information systems components alone would not have achieved Kaiser Permanente's success, the strategy of integrating health coverage and care delivery has been a critical factor in enabling Kaiser Permanente to provide coordinated, high-quality, and cost-effective care to its members.

The Information Systems Strategy Triangle

These need to be balanced.

Business Strategy

What is a business strategy?
+ It is where a business seeks to go and how it expects to get there
+ It is not a business model, although it includes business models as one component of a business strategy
+ Business models include subscriptions, advertising, licenses, etc.
+ Business models do not include where the business seeks to go, and only the revenue portion of how it expects to get there

Generic Strategies Framework
+ Michael Porter: How businesses can build a competitive advantage
+ Three primary strategies for achieving competitive advantage:
+ Cost leadership –lowest-cost producer.
+ Differentiation –product is unique.
+ Focus–limited scope –can accomplish this via cost leadership or differentiation within the segment

Dynamic Strategies
+ Beware of Hypercompetition
+ Speed & aggressiveness of the moves & countermoves in a highly competitive turbulent market in which advantages are rapidly created & eroded
+ Can lead to a “red ocean” environment
+ Cutthroat competition –zero sum game
+ Every advantage is eroded —becoming a cost.
+ Sustaining an advantage can be a deadly distraction from creating new ones.
+ D'Avenis says: Goal of advantage should be disruption, not sustainability
+ Initiatives are achieved through series of small steps. Get new advantage before old one erodes .
+ Better to adopt a “blue ocean” strategy
+ Change the industry; create new segments/products
  
Creative Destruction
+ GE’s Approach under Jack Welch
+ Ask people to imagine how to destroy and grow your business
+ DYB: Imagine how competitors would want to destroy your business.
+ GYB: Counteract that by growing the business in some way to:
  + Reach new customers/markets
  + Better serve existing customers
  
Summary

Strategic Approach Key Idea Application to Information Systems 

Porter’s generic strategiesFirms achieve competitive advantage through cost leadership, differentiation, or focus. Understanding which strategy is chosen by a firm is critical to choosing information systems to complement the strategy.

Dynamic environment strategies

Speed, agility, and aggressive moves and countermoves by a firm create competitive advantage. The speed of change is too fast for manual response making information systems critical to achieving business goals.
