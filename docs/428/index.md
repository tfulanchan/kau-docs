## Computer and Internet Crime

A firm should carefully weigh the costs and benefits of prosecution, consider factors like publicity, legal expenses, and the potential to deter future crime.

Effort and money spent should align with a company's risk tolerance, industry standards, and the potential impact of breachesâ€”essentially, "safe enough" is when the protection cost is justifiable by the risk it mitigates.

If a company realizes it has produced defective software, it should immediately release a patch, inform affected customers, and take steps to prevent future issues.

The firm should strike a balance by adjusting security measures to minimize business disruption while maintaining essential protections.

Resources spent on safeguarding against computer crime should be proportional to the potential losses from an attack and legal compliance requirements.

Immediate actions should include patching vulnerabilities, informing customers, and enhancing future development practices to prevent further security risks.

If security measures increase costs, the company should review and optimize them to ensure they are both effective and efficient, minimizing impact on business operations.

Zero-day attack: Takes place before the security community or software developer knows about the vulnerability or has been able to repair it
