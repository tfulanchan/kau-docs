Sloan Valve
+ What was wrong with their Product Development Process?
+ What did Sloan do? What is NPD?
+ Did it help?
+ Are all enterprise system implementations this successful?

Sloan Valve, a prominent company, faced challenges with its product development process that prompted a significant transformation. Their existing new product development (NPD) process was inefficient, leading to lengthy time-to-market for new products, which averaged 24 months.

To address these issues, Sloan Valve implemented a strategic initiative to reengineer its NPD process. The company leveraged product lifecycle management (PLM) systems to streamline and optimize its product development workflow. By integrating PLM, Sloan Valve was able to reduce the time-to-market for new products to less than 12 months, a significant improvement from the previous 24-month timeline.

The successful implementation of PLM at Sloan Valve highlights the potential of enterprise systems in driving business transformation. The company's efforts to reengineer its NPD process, supported by IT capabilities, resulted in enhanced efficiency, reduced time-to-market, and improved product quality.

It is important to note that not all enterprise system implementations are as successful as Sloan Valve's. Factors such as organizational culture, change management, and alignment with business goals play a crucial role in determining the success of such initiatives. While Sloan Valve's case demonstrates the potential benefits of IT-led process reengineering, it is not a guarantee of success for all companies undertaking similar transformations.

#### Silo perspective and business process perspective

Silo (Functional) Perspective
+ Specialized functions (sales, accounting, production, etc.)
+ Advantages:
  + Allows optimization of expertise.
  + Group like functions together for transfer of knowledge.
+ Disadvantages:
  + Sub-optimization (reinvent wheel; gaps in communication; bureaucracy)
  + Tend to lose sight of overall organizational objectives.

The Process Perspective
+ Examples of processes:
  + Fulfill customer orders
  + Manufacturing, planning, execution
  + Procurement
+ Processes have:
  + Beginning and an end
  + Inputs and outputs
  + A process to convert inputs into outputs
  + Metrics to measure effectiveness
+ They cross functions 

The silo perspective in organizational structures involves grouping functions based on similarities, leading to specialized departments that operate independently, potentially resulting in sub-optimization, communication gaps, and bureaucracy. In contrast, the business process perspective emphasizes a cross-functional approach, cutting across traditional silos to promote coordination, communication, and efficiency across departments, ensuring processes flow smoothly towards organizational objectives by minimizing obstacles, duplication of tasks, and delays. This shift focuses on what needs to be done rather than who does what. It encourages intense coordination and communication to drive organizational success through effective and efficient process flows.

Procurment:
1. Receive Requirement for Goods/Services
2. Create and Send 
3. Purchase Order
4. Receive Goods
5. Verify Invoice
6. Pay Vendor

Cross-Functional Nature of Business Processes

How to Manage a Process
+ Identify the customers of processes (who receives the output?)
+ Identify the customers' requirements (how do we judge success?)
+ Clarify the value each process adds to the organizational goals
+ Share this perspective so the organization itself becomes more process focused

Comparison of Silo Perspective and Business Process Perspective

| | Silo Perspective | Business Process Perspective |
|-|------------------|------------------|
| Definition | Self-contained functional units such as marketing, operations, finance | Interrelated, sequential set of activities and tasks that turns inputs into outputs |
| Focus | Functional | Cross-functional |
| Goal Accomplishment | Optimizes on functional goals, which might be suboptimal for the organization | Optimizes on organizational goals, or the “big picture” |
| Benefits | Highlighting and developing core competencies; functional efficiencies | Avoiding work duplication and cross -functional communication gaps; organizational effectiveness |
| Problems | Redundancy of information throughout the organization; cross-functional inefficiencies; communication problems | Difficult to find knowledgeable generalists; sophisticated software is needed |

What do you do when things change?
+ Dynamic and agile processes
+ Examples:
  + Agile: Autos are built with wires and space for options
  + Dynamic: Call centers route incoming or even outgoing calls to available locations and agents
  + Software defined architectures (see chapter 6)
+ IT is required to pull this off well
  
#### Dynamic and Agile Processes

When things change, organizations need to adapt quickly to stay competitive. This requires dynamic and agile processes that can respond to changing requirements and priorities.

##### Examples of Dynamic and Agile Processes

* **Agile:** Autos are built with wires and space for options, allowing for flexibility in design and production.
* **Dynamic:** Call centers route incoming or even outgoing calls to available locations and agents, ensuring efficient use of resources.
* **Software Defined Architectures:** These architectures enable rapid changes to software applications and services, without requiring significant rework or rearchitecture (see chapter 6).

##### Role of IT in Dynamic and Agile Processes

IT plays a critical role in enabling dynamic and agile processes. It provides the infrastructure and tools necessary to support rapid change and adaptation.

##### Characteristics of Agile Companies

Agile companies are characterized by their ability to respond quickly to changes in the market, workplace, or customer behavior. They have flexible business models that are regularly reviewed and adjusted to ensure optimal performance.

##### Core Characteristics of Agile Companies

* **Customer-centric:** Agile companies are focused on responding to the changing needs, wants, and demands of their audience.
* **Flexible structure:** Agile companies don't operate a rigid, top-down hierarchy, instead using more varied structures that enable rapid adaptation.
* **Shared purpose and vision:** Agile companies have a shared purpose and vision that encompasses every employee, team, and department, driving open communication and collaboration.
* **Resource sharing:** Agile employees are comfortable sharing even scarce company resources and are empowered to make decisions.

By adopting dynamic and agile processes, organizations can stay ahead of the competition and thrive in a rapidly changing business environment.

Techniques to transform a static process
+ Radical process redesign 
+ Also known as business process reengineering
+ Incremental, continuous process improvement
+ Including Total Quality Management and Six Sigma

Incremental Change
+ Total Quality Management
+ Often results in favorable reactions from personnel
  + Improvements are owned and controlled
  + Less threatening change
+ Six-Sigma is one popular approach to Total Quality Management
  + Developed at Motorola
  + Institutionalized at GE for "near-perfect products"
  + Generally regarded as 3.4 defects per million opportunities for defect (6 std dev from mean)

Radical Change
+ Business Process Reengineering
+ Sets aggressive improvement goals.
+ Goal is to make a rapid, breakthrough impact on key metrics in a short amount of time.
+ Greater resistance by personnel.
+ Use only when radical change is needed.

Key Aspects of Radical Change Approaches
+ Need for quick, major change
+ Thinking from a cross-functional process perspective
+ Challenge to old assumptions
+ Networked (cross-functional organization)
+ Empowerment of individuals in the process
+ Measurement of success via metrics tied to business goals and effectiveness of new processes
  
Workflow and Mapping Processes
+ Workflow diagrams show a picture of the sequence and detail of each process step
+ Objective is to understand and communicate the dimensions of the process
+ Over 200 products are available to do this
+ High-level overview chart plus detailed flow diagram of the process

Business Process Management
+ Information systems tools used to enable information flow within and between processes.
+ Comprehensive, enterprise software packages.
  + ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning ), 
  + CRM (Customer Relationship Management), 
  + SCM (Supply Chain Management)
+ Designed to manage the potentially hundreds of systems throughout a large organization.
+ SAP, Oracle, Peoplesoft are the most widely used ERP software packages in large organizations.
  
Business Process Management Architecture

Standardization vs Integration

| | | | Business Process Standardization |
|-|-|-|-|
| | | Low | High | 
| Business Process Integration | High | Single face to customers and suppliers but standards not enforced internally | High needs for reliability, predictability, and sharing; single view of process |
| Business Process Integration | Low | Decentralized design; business units decide how to meet customer needs | Tasks are done the same way across units, but there is little need for business units to interact |

#### Enterprise resource planning
+ Seamlessly integrate information flows throughout the company.
+ Reflect industry best practices.
+ Need to be integrated with existing hardware, OS, databases, and telecommunications.
+ Some assembly(customization) is required
+ The systems evolve to fit the needs of the diverse marketplace.

ERP II
+ Makes information available to external stakeholders too
+ Enables e-business applications
+ Integrates into the cloud
+ Includes ERP plus other functions

ERP and ERP II Functions
  
Customer Relationship Management
+ Customer Relationship Management is a natural extension of applying the value chain model to customers.
+ CRM includes many management activities performed to 
+ obtain, 
+ enhance relationships with, and 
+ retain customers.
+ CRM can lead to better customer service, which leads to competitive advantage for the business.
+ Common systems are:
  + Oracle
  + SAP
  + Salesforce.com (web -based cloud system)
  + Oracle and SAP integrate into their ERP systems
  
Supply Chain Management
+ An enterprise system that manages the integrated supply chain
+ Translation: processes are linked across companies
+ The single network optimizes costs and opportunities for all companies in the supply chain
+ Every part of the supply chain has the latest information about sales expected and inventories from source materials at all stages
+ Bullwhip effect occurs when the supplier at each stage adds a small “buffer” for it’s suppliers in case demand is higher than expected

Difficulties in Integrated Supply Chains
+ Information integration requires agreement of what information to share, how to share it, and the authority to view it.
+ Trust must be established
+ Planning must be synchronized carefully
+ Workflow must be coordinated between partners to determine what to do with the information they obtain
  
Advantages and Disadvantages of Enterprise Systems

The Adoption Decision
+ The enterprise system sometimes should drive business process redesign when:
+ Just starting out.
+ Organizational processes are not relied upon for strategic advantage.
+ Current systems are in crisis.
+ It is inappropriate for the enterprise system to drive business process redesign when:
+ Changing an organization's processes that are relied upon for strategic advantage.
+ The package does not fit the organization.
+ There is a lack of top management support.
