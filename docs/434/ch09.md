Intel’s Transformation
+ Huge performance improvements between 2013 and 2014
+ Was it due to a spending increase?
+ Intel ’s evolution
+  1992: Centralized IT
+  2003: Protect Era –lockdown (SOX & virus)
+  2009: Protect to Enable Era (BYOD pressure)

Intel Reached Level 3:
1. Developing programs and delivering services
2. Contributing business value
3. Transforming the firm

Previously: categorized problems as “business ” or “IT”

Now: Integrated solutions are the only way 

Intel's IT governance has evolved significantly over the past few decades, driven by the need to adapt to changing business requirements and technological advancements. In the early 1990s, Intel had a centralized IT structure, but as the company faced increasing regulatory pressures and security threats in the early 2000s, it shifted to a more protective approach, locking down systems and enforcing strict controls. However, by 2009, the rise of bring-your-own-device trends and the need to enable business innovation prompted Intel to move towards a more enabling IT governance model, where IT began developing programs and delivering services that contributed direct business value and transformed the firm. This evolution allowed Intel to achieve significant performance improvements between 2013 and 2014, not due to increased spending, but rather through the implementation of effective IT governance practices that aligned IT with business objectives and enabled digital transformation.

### IT Governance
+ Governance (in business) is all about making decisions that
  + Define expectations
  + Grant authority
  + Ensure performance
+ Empowerment and monitoring will help align behavior with business goals.
  + Empowerment: granting the right to make decisions.
  + Monitoring: evaluating performance .
+ IT governance focuses on how decision rights can be distributed differently to facilitate three possible modes of decision making:
  + centralized, 
  + decentralized, or 
  + hybrid
+ Organizational structure plays a major role .
 
Four Perspectives
+ Traditional –Centralized vs decentralized
+ Accountability and allocation of decision rights
+ Ecosystem
+ Control structures from legislation
 
Centralized vs. Decentralized Organizational Structures
+ Centralized –bring together all staff, hardware, software, data, and processing into a single location.
+ Decentralized –the components in the centralized structure are scattered in different locations to address local business needs.
+ Federalism –a hybrid of centralized and decentralized structures.
 
Organizational continuum

### Federalism
+ Most companies would like to achieve the advantages of both centralization and decentralization.
+ Leads to federalism
  + Distributes, power,  hardware, software, data and personnel  
  + Between a central information systems group and information systems in business units
  + A hybrid approach
  + Some decisions centralized; some decentralized

![Federal IT](./assets/federalIT.jpg)

Federalism in IT governance refers to a system where decision-making and accountability for IT policies are shared between central IT functions and divisional IT staff. Centralized governance <strong>grants the corporate IT function full authority over IT matters</strong>, where decentralized governance <strong>assigns responsibility to individual divisions</strong>. Federal IT governance, on the other hand, involves a shared governance structure where <strong>both corporate and divisional IT staff are involved in decision-making</strong>, with varying degrees of decentralization. This approach allows for a balance between standardization and customization, <strong>enabling greater responsiveness to business unit needs while maintaining control over standards and economies of scale</strong>. The evolution of IT governance within organizations mirrors the principles of federalism, emphasizing the importance of aligning IT strategies with business objectives and adapting to changing technological landscapes to drive effective decision-making and business transformation.

Recent Global Survey

Percent of firms reporting that they are:
+ Centralized: 70.6%
+ Decentralized: 13.5%
+ Federated: 12.7%
 
Centralized IT governance involves decision-making authority concentrated within a single entity, allowing for greater control over standards and economies of scale. This structure promotes efficiency, streamlined processes, and enhanced accountability. On the other hand, decentralized IT governance distributes decision-making responsibilities to divisions, enabling customization and responsiveness but risking a lack of consistency and accountability. While centralization offers efficiency and accountability, it may stifle innovation, whereas decentralization can foster creativity but lead to a disconnect between decision-makers and stakeholders. Striking a balance between these models is crucial for optimal organizational functioning and success.

Centralized IT governance consolidates decision-making at the top for streamlined processes and consistency, but can lead to bureaucracy and disempowered local units, while decentralized governance disperses decision-making among various management levels to promote flexibility and faster responses to changing needs, but may result in coordination challenges and inconsistencies across units.

Federal IT governance combines elements of both, sharing governance between corporate and divisional IT staff. Federal IT governance offers benefits such as improved service delivery, cost reduction, increased agility, enhanced security, and better integration and interoperability across government entities, ultimately leading to more efficient operations and better services.

Five major categories of IT decisions !/

| Category | Description | Examples of Affected information systems Activities |
|----------|-------------|------------------------------------|
| IT Principles | determine IT assets that are needed | participate in setting strategic direction |
| IT Architecture | structure IT assets | establish architecture  and standards |
| IT Infrastructure Strategies | build IT assets | manage Internet and  network services; data; human resources; mobile computing |
| Business Application Needs | acquire, implement and maintain IT  (insource or outsource) | develop and maintaining information systems |
| IT Investment and Prioritization | How much to invest and where to invest in IT assets | anticipate new technologies |

Political Archetypes (Weill & Ross)
+ Archetypes label the combinations of people who either provide information or have key IT decision rights
  + Business monarchy, IT monarchy, feudal, federal, IT duopoly, and anarchy.
  + Decisions can be made at several levels in the organization
  + Enterprise-wide, business unit, and region/group within a business unit.
 
Political Archetypes
+ Organizations vary widely in their archetypes selected
  + The duopoly is used by the largest portion (36%) of organizations for IT principles decisions.
  + IT monarchy is the most popular for IT architecture (73%) and infrastructure decisions (59%).

Emergent Governance: Digital Ecosystems
+ Challenge a "top down" approach
+ Self-interested, self-organizing, autonomous sets of technologies from different sources
+ Firms find opportunities to exploit new technologies that were not anticipated
+ Good examples:
  + Google Maps
  + YouTube
186241272305
Electronic Health Record
+ Can connect to planned sources:
  + Pharmacy
  + Lab
  + Insurance Company
+ Can connect to unplanned sources:
  + Banks –for payment
  + Tax authority –for matching deductions
  + Smartphone apps –for many purposes

How to govern in this case?
+ Might be difficult to impossible!
+ The systems might simply emerge and evolve over time
+ No one entity can plan these systems in their entirety

Mechanisms for Making Decisions
+ Policies and Standards (60% of firms)
+ Review board or committee
+ Steering committee (or governance council)
  + Key stakeholders
  + Can be at different levels:
    + Higher level (focus on CIO effectiveness)
    + Lower level (focus on details of various projects)
 
### Summary of Three Governance Frameworks
/

| Governance Framework | Main Concept | Possible Best Practice |
|----------------------|--------------|-------------------------|
| Centralization - Decentralization | Decisions can be made by a central authority or by autonomous individuals or groups in an organization. | A hybrid, Federal approach |
| Decision Archetypes | Specifying patterns based upon allocating decision rights and accountability. | Tailor the archetype to the situation |
| Digital Ecosystems | Members of the ecosystem contribute their strengths, giving the whole ecosystem a complete set of capabilities. | Build flexibility and adaptability into governance. |

Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SoX) (2002)
+ To increase regulatory visibility and accountability of public companies and their financial health
  + All companies subject to the SEC are subject to SoX.
  + + CEOs and CFOs must personally certify and be accountable for their firm’s financial records and accounting.
  + Firms must provide real-time disclosures of any events that may affect a firm’s stock price or financial performance.
  + Those who knowingly submitted inaccurate reports face a fine of up to $5,000,000, or 20 years in prison
  + IT departments play a major role in ensuring the accuracy of financial data .

The [Sarbanes Oxley Act](https://sarbanes-oxley-act.com/) gives to the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board four primary responsibilities:
- registration of accounting firms that audit public companies in the U.S. securities markets;
- inspections of registered accounting firms;
- establishment of auditing, quality control, and ethics standards for registered accounting firms; and
- investigation and discipline of registered accounting firms for violations of law or professional standards.

Under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, management has to establish, assess and report on the issuer's system of internal controls over financial reporting, and auditors must report on the effectiveness of that system of internal controls. Studies show that better internal controls result in better financial reporting and more investor confidence in financial reports.

IT Control and Sarbanes-Oxley
+ In 2004 and 2005, IT departments began to 
  + Identify controls
  + Determine design effectiveness
  + Test to validate operation of controls

### IT Control and Sarbanes-Oxley
Five IT control weaknesses are repeatedly uncovered by auditors:
+ <strong>Failure to segregate duties within applications</strong>, and failure to set up new accounts and terminate old ones in a timely manner
+ <strong>Lack of proper oversight for making application changes</strong>, including appointing a person to make a change and another to perform quality assurance on it
+ <strong>Inadequate review of audit logs</strong> to not only ensure that systems were running smoothly but that there also was an audit log of the audit log
+ <strong>Failure to identify abnormal transactions in a timely manner</strong>
+ Failure to identify abnormal transactions in a timely manner

Frameworks for Implementing SoX
+ [Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission](https://www.coso.org/).
+ Created three control objectives for management and auditors that focused on dealing with risks to internal control
  + Operations –maintain and improve operating effectiveness; protect the firm's assets
  + Compliance –with relevant laws and regulations.
  + Financial reporting –in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
 
Control Components

Five essential control components were created to make sure a company is meeting its objectives:
+ Control environment (culture of the firm)
+ Assessment of most critical risks to internal controls
+ Control processes that outline important processes and guidelines
+ Communication of those procedures
+ Monitoring of internal controls by management  

Frameworks
+ COBIT (Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology) 
  + IT governance framework that is consistent with COSO controls.
  + Issued in 1996 by Information Systems Audit & Control Association (ISACA)
  + A company must 
    + Determine the processes/risks to be managed.
    + Set up control objectives and KPIs (key performance indicators)
    + Develop activities to reach the KPIs
  + Advantages -well-suited to organizations focused on risk management and mitigation, and very detailed.
  + Disadvantages –costly and time consuming

Information systems and the Implementation of SoX compliance
+ The information systems department and CIO are involved with the implementation of SoX.
+ Section  deals with management’s assessment of internal controls.
+ Six tactics that CIOs can use in working with auditors, CFOs, and CEOs :
  1. Knowledge building (Build a knowledge base)
  2. Knowledge deployment (Disseminate knowledge to management.)
  3. Innovation directive (Organize for implementing SoX)
  4. Mobilization (Persuade players and subsidiaries to cooperate)
  5. Standardization (Negotiate agreements, build rules)
  6. Subsidy (Fund the costs)
+ A CIO’s ability to employ these various tactics depends upon his/her power (relating to the SoX implementation).

==========================================================

• The chief information officer (CIO) is a high-level IS officer who performs many important organizational functions, including championing the organization, managing the IT architecture and infrastructure, participating in the development of business and IT strategy, planning for technology, overseeing application development, sourcing, overseeing training, advising on emerging technologies, interfacing with internal and external customers, and planning for business discontinuities.

• IS organizations can be expected to anticipate new technologies, participate in setting and implementing strategic goals, innovate current processes, develop and maintain information systems, manage supplier relationships, establish architecture platforms and standards, promote enterprise security, plan for business discontinuities, manage data/information/knowledge, manage Internet and network services, manage human resources, operate the data center, and provide general support. It does not perform core business functions or independently develop business strategy.

• Because each organization differs depending on the nature of the enterprise, a business manager must know the particular needs of his or her organization—just as the IS manager must educate him or her on the IT available. If neither seeks the other out, then a schism can develop between business and IS. The enterprise will suffer due to missed opportunities and expensive mistakes

• In addition to understanding the structure of an IS organization, a manager should work with IT leaders to develop a lean, competitive enterprise in which IT acts as a strategic enabler. Working as a team, business and IS managers can fruitfully address crucial organizational issues such as outsourcing, centralization, and globalization. Such collaboration is essential if the enterprise is to remain afloat amid the difficult waters of business competition.

• IT governance specifies how to allocate decision rights in such a way as to encourage desirable behavior in the use of IT. The allocation of decision rights can be broken down into six archetypes (business monarchy, IT monarchy, feudal, federal, IT duopoly, and anarchy). High-performing companies use the proper decision rights
allocation patterns for each of the five major categories of IT decisions.

• Alternative structuring approaches are possible. Centralized IS organizations place IT staff, hardware, software, and data in one location to promote control and efficiency. At the other end of the continuum, decentralized IS organizations with distributed resources can best meet the needs of local users. Federalism is in the middle of the centralized/decentralized continuum.

• Global MIS organizations face a host of issues that domestic departments avoid. Geopolitical risk, language and cultural barriers, business continuity planning, and transborder data flow issues must be reexamined in a global organization, and each country’s laws and policies considered in the architectural design.

1. Using an organization with which you are familiar, describe the role of the most senior IS professional. Is that person a strategist or an operationalist?

    The most senior IS professional, typically the Chief Information Officer (CIO), plays a crucial role in aligning IT strategy with business objectives. While CIOs must be well-versed in operational aspects, their primary focus is on strategic planning, innovation, and leveraging technology to drive business growth.

2. What advantages does a CIO bring to a business? What might be the disadvantages of having a CIO?

    A CIO brings several advantages to a business, including the ability to bridge the gap between IT and other departments, drive digital transformation, and optimize IT investments for maximum return. However, a CIO may also face challenges in communicating technical concepts to non-IT executives and ensuring that IT initiatives are aligned with the overall business strategy.

3. The debate about centralization and decentralization is heating up again with the advent of network computing and the increasing use of the Internet. Why does the Internet make this debate topical?

    The Internet has reignited the debate between centralization and decentralization in IT governance. The Internet's ubiquity and the rise of cloud computing have made it possible to centralize IT resources and services, while also enabling greater collaboration and communication across geographically dispersed teams.

4. Why is the concept of decision rights important?

    Decision rights are crucial in IT governance because they define who has the authority to make decisions and who is accountable for the outcomes. Clearly defined decision rights help to avoid conflicts, ensure consistency, and promote efficient decision-making.

5. Why can an IT governance archetype be good for one type of IS decision but not for another?

    The effectiveness of an IT governance archetype depends on the specific type of IS decision being made. For example, a centralized archetype may be more suitable for decisions related to enterprise-wide standards and policies, while a decentralized archetype may be better suited for decisions that require local expertise and flexibility.
