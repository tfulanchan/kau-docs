Sourcing Decision Framework 

Sourcing Options

| | Insourcing | Outsourcing |
|-|-|-|
| Domestic | Domestic in-house production<br/>company produces its products domestically without any outside contracts | Domestic outsourcing <br />company uses services supplied by another domestic-based company |
| Offshore | Offshore in-house sourcing<br/>company uses services supplied by its own foreign -based affiliate (subsidiary) | Offshore outsourcing <br />company uses services supplied by an unaffiliated foreign-based company |

Insourcing

A firm provides information systems services or develops information systems in its own in-house information systems organization

IT outsourcing
+ With IT, there is equipment and personnel involved
+ Equipment and facilities are sold to outside vendors
+ Personnel might be hired by outside vendors
+ Services are hired from the vendors
+ Common length of agreement: 10 years

### Insourcing drivers and challenges
| Insourcing Drivers | Insourcing Challenges |
|--------------------|-----------------------|
| <ul><li>Core competencies related to systems</li><li>Confidentiality or sensitive system components or services</li><li>Time available in-house to develop software</li><li>Expertise for software development in-house</li></ul> | <ul><li>Inadequate support from top management to acquire needed resources</li><li>Temptation from finding a reliable, competent outsourcing provider</li></ul> |

Economics of outsourcing
+ Benefits:
  + Sell equipment, buildings (large cash inflow)
  + Downsized payroll –outsourcer hires employees
+ Costs:
  + Services provided for a fee
  + Fixed costs usually over 10-year term

### Drivers and disadvantages of outsourcing
| Drivers | Disadvantages |
|---------|---------------|
|<ul><li>Offer cost savings</li><li>Offer service quality</li><li>Ease transition to new technologies</li><li>Offer better strategic focus</li><li>Provide better management of Information Systems staff</li><li>Handle peaks</li><li>Consolidate data centers</li><li>Infusion of cash</li></ul> |<ul><li>Abdication of control</li><li>High switching costs</li><li>Lack of technological innovation</li><li>Loss of strategic advantage</li><li>Reliance on outsourcer</li><li>Problems with security/confidentiality</li><li>Evaporation of cost savings</li></ul> |

How to outsource successfully
+ Decisions about whether or not to outsource need care and deliberation.
+ Requires numerous other decisions about mitigating outsourcing risks.
  + Three major decision areas: selection, contracting, and scope
  1. Selection: find compatible providers
  2. Contracting:
     1. Try for flexible management terms
     2. Try for shorter (3-5 year) contracts
     3. Try for Service Level Agreements on performance
  3. Scope –Determine if full or partial outsourcing

Offshoring
+ Short for outsourcing offshore
+ Definition:
  + When the MIS organization uses contractor services in a distant land. (Insourcing offshore would be your own dept offshore)
+ Substantial potential cost savings through reduced labor costs.
+ Some countries offer a very well educated labor force.
+ Implementation of quality standards:
  + Six Sigma
  + ISO 

### Selecting an Offshoring Destination
+ About 100 countries are now exporting software services and products.
+ What makes countries attractive for offshoring?
  + High English language proficiency.
  + Countries that are peaceful/politically stable.
  + Countries with lower crime rates.
  + Countries with friendly relationships.
  + Security and/or trade restrictions.
  + Protects intellectual property
  + Level of technical infrastructure available.
  + Good, efficient labor force
+ Once a country is selected, the particular city in that country needs to be assessed as well.
+ Countries like India make an entire industry of offshoring.
+ Software Engineering Institute’s Capability Maturity Model (CMM). 
  + Level 1: the software development processes are immature, bordering on chaotic. 
  + Level 5: processes are quite mature, sophisticated, systematic, reliable
  + Indian firms are well known for their CMM Level  software development processes, making them desirable

Offshore Destination - Development Tiers

Carmel and Tjia suggest that there are three tiers of software exporting nations:
+  Tier 1: Mature
   +  United Kingdom, United States, Japan, Germany, France, Canada, the 
   Netherlands, Sweden, Finland, India, Ireland, Israel, China, and Russia .
+  Tier 2: Emerging
   +  Brazil, Costa Rica, South Korea, and many Eastern European countries .
+  Tier 3: Infant
   +  Cuba, Vietnam, Jordan, and 15 to 25 others.
+ Tiers: based on industrial maturity, the extent of clustering of some critical mass of software enterprises, and export revenues. 
+ The higher tiered countries have higher levels of skills and higher costs.

### Farshoring
+ Definition: sourcing service work to a foreign, lower-wage country that is relatively far away in distance or time zone.
+ Client company hopes to benefit from one or more ways: 
  + Big cost savings due to exchange rates, labor costs, government subsidies, etc.
+ For the US and UK, India and China are popular
+ Oddly, India and China also offshore to other locations

### Nearshoring
+ Definition: sourcing service work to a foreign, lower-wage country that is relatively close in distance or time zone.
+ Client company hopes to benefit from one or more ways of being close: 
+ Geographically, temporally, culturally, linguistically, economically, politically or from historical linkages. 
+ Distance and language matter.
+ There are three major global nearshore clusters :
+ 20 nations around the U.S., and Canada
+ 27 countries around Western Europe
+ smaller cluster of three countries in East Asia

### Captive Centers
+ An overseas subsidiary that is set up to serve the parent company.
+ Alternative to offshoring or nearshoring.
+ Four major stategies that are being employed: 
  + <strong>Hybrid Captive</strong> –performs core business processes for parent company 
  but outsources noncore work to offshore provider
  + <strong>Shared Captive</strong> - performs work for both parent company and external 
  customers.
  + <strong>Divested captive</strong> - have a large enough scale and scope that it could be 
  sold for a profit by the parent company. 
  + <strong>Terminated Captive</strong> - has been shut down, usually because its inferior service was hurting the parent company’s reputation. 
  
Captive centers are client-owned-and-operated service delivery centers, typically in a nondomestic, low-cost location, that provide service resources directly to their organization. The personnel in a captive facility are legal employees of the organization, not the vendor. ([Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/captive-centers#:~:text=Captive%20centers%20are%20client%2Downed,the%20organization%2C%20not%20the%20vendor.))

Backsourcing
+ When a company takes back in-house, previously outsourced, IS assets, activities, and skills.
+ Partial or complete reversal
+ Many companies have backsourced such as Continental Airlines, Cable and Wireless, and Halifax Bank of Scotland.
+ 70% of outsourcing clients have had negative experiences and 25% have backsourced .
+ 4% of  North American companies would not consider backsourcing .

### Backsourcing Reasons
+ Mirror reason for outsourcing (to reduce costs, increase quality of service, etc.)
+ Costs were higher than expected
+ Poor service
+ Change in management
+ Change in the way Information Systems is perceived within the company
+ New situations (mergers, acquisitions, etc.)

### Crowdsourcing
+ Definition:
  + Taking a task traditionally performed by an employee or contractor, and 
  + Outsourcing it to an undefined, generally large group of people, 
  + In the form of an open call.
+ Used by companies to increase productivity, lower production costs, and fill skill gaps.
+ Can be used for a variety of tasks.
+ Companies do not have control over the people doing the work.

Partnering Arrangements
+ Strategic networks: arrangements made with other organizations to offer synergistic or complementary services
+ Example: 三井グループ contains over 30 firms spanning many industries. The members use each others’ services and don’t compete: Toshiba, Fujifilm, Sony are members
+ Business ecosystems (see chapter 9): Informal, emerging relationships
  
Deciding Where -Onshore, Offshore, or in the Cloud?
+ New option: cloud computing 
+ See chapter 6 for basic definitions; advantages; disadvantages .
+ Works when outsourcing or insourcing

Cloud Computing Options
+ On-premise
+ Private clouds
  + Data —managed by the company or offsite by a third party. 
+ Community clouds.
  + Cloud infrastructure is shared by several organizations 
  + Supports the shared concerns of a specific community.
+ Public clouds.
  + Data is stored outside of the corporate data centers 
  + In the cloud provider’s environment
+ Hybrid clouds
  + Combination of two or more other clouds.

### Cloud service models
+ Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).
  + Infrastructure through grids or clusters of virtualized servers, networks, storage, and systems software.
  + Designed to augment or replace the functions of an entire data center.
  + The customer may have full control of the actual server configuration.
  + More risk management control over the data and environment.
+ Platform as a Service (PaaS).
  + Virtualized servers 
  + Clients can run existing applications or develop new ones
  + Provider manages the hardware, operating system, and capacity
  + Limits the enterprise risk management capabilities.

IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) provides virtualized computing resources over the internet, allowing users to rent access to servers, storage, and networking without managing the underlying infrastructure. 

PaaS (Platform as a Service) provides a platform for developers to build, test, and deploy applications, including operating systems, databases, and development tools, without the complexity of managing the underlying infrastructure.

SaaS (Software as a Service) delivers software applications over the internet, where the provider hosts and maintains the software, databases, and servers, making it accessible via a web browser.

Infrastructure as a Service provides the most flexibility and control, allowing you to customize the infrastructure to your exact needs, but requires more management overhead. Platform as a Service simplifies development by providing a platform with tools and frameworks, but has less flexibility and more potential for vendor lock-in. Software as a Service offers the most convenience as fully managed software accessible via the web, but has the least control and customization options. The best choice depends on specific requirements - Infrastructure as a Service is ideal for highly customized workloads, Platform as a Service speeds up development of custom apps, and Software as a Service is perfect for quickly deploying common business software with minimal overhead.

Software as a Service (SaaS) or Application Service Provider (ASP).
  + Software application functionality through a web browser. 
  + The platform and infrastructure are fully managed by the cloud 
  provider.
  + If the operating system or underlying service isn’t configured 
  correctly, the data at the higher application layer may be at risk. 
  + The most widely known and used form of cloud computing.

Some managers shy away from cloud computing because they are 
concerned about:
  + Security — specifically about external threats from remote 
  hackers and security breaches as the data travels to and from 
  the cloud.
  + Data privacy

==========================================================

• IT is funded using one of three methods: chargeback, allocation, or corporate budget.

• Chargeback systems are viewed as the most equitable method of IT cost recovery because costs are distributed based on usage. Creating an accounting system to record the information necessary to do a chargeback system can be expensive and time consuming and usually has no other useful application.

• Allocation systems provide a simpler method to recover costs, because they do not involve recording system usage to allocate costs. However, allocation systems can sometimes penalize groups with low usage.

• Corporate budgeting systems do not allocate costs at all. Instead, the CIO seeks and receives a budget from the corporate overhead account. This method of funding IT does not require any usage recordkeeping, but is also most likely to be abused if the users perceive ‘‘it is free.’’

• Total cost of ownership is a technique to understand all the costs, beyond the initial investment costs, associated with owning and operating an information system. It is most useful as a tool to help evaluate which infrastructure components to choose and to help understand how infrastructure costs occur.

• Activity-based costing is another technique to group costs into a meaningful bucket. Costs are accounted for based on the activity, or product or service, they support. ABC is useful for allocating large overhead expenses.

• The portfolio of IT investments must be carefully evaluated and managed.

• ROI is difficult, at best, to calculate for IT investments because the benefits are often not tangible. The benefits might be difficult to quantify, difficult to observe, or long range in scope.

• Popular metrics for IT investments measure quality of information outputs, IT contributions to a firm’s financial performance, operational efficiency, management/user attitudes, and the adequacy of systems development practices.

• A business case is a tool used to support a decision or a proposal of a new investment. It is a document containing a project description, financial analysis, marketing analysis, and all other relevant documentation to assist managers in making a go/no-go decision.

• Benefits articulated in a business case can be categorized as observable, measurable, quantifiable, and financial. These benefits are often for innovations, improvements, or cessation.

• Monitoring and communicating the status and benefits of IT is often done through the use of balanced scorecards and IT dashboards.

• Options pricing offers a risk-hedging strategy to minimize the negative impact of risk when resolving uncertainty by waiting to see what happens.

1. Under what conditions would you recommend using each of these funding methods: allocation, chargeback, and corporate budgeting?
2. Describe the conditions under which ROI, payback period, NPV, and EVA are most appropriately applied.
4. Would you suggest using options pricing on the investment described in Question 3? Why or why not?
5. Compare and contrast the IT scorecard and dashboard approaches.
6. TCO is one way to account for costs associated with a specific infrastructure. This method does not include additional costs such as disposal costs—the cost to get rid of the system when it is no longer of use. What other additional costs might be of importance in making total cost calculations?
