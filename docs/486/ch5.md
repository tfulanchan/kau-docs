### Introduction

In the previous chapters, comprehensive evidence was presented to illustrate some changes in the business environment.

These changes are leading to the emergence of rules that are different from the current tested rules of the industrial economy.

If the rules of the game are changing, all players in the game—including private and public sector organizations—need to re-evaluate and transform their strategies, business models, and organizational designs.

The changes will lead to existing organizations not surviving, while new and different ones will emerge.

One question that arises is whether they have been led to accept the changes in the new business environment that require developing new organizations.

Therefore, organizations have to adopt strategic and organizational innovations by exploiting the new capabilities from ICTs.

However, it remains unclear how the Internet could or should have such effects on business strategies and organizational designs.

### Transaction Cost Economics

To answer this question, this chapter will present the theory of transaction cost economics to illustrate the relationships between the Internet and changes in industrial structures and organizational boundaries.

In economics and related disciplines, a transaction cost is the extra price that should be paid on top of a service, such as the commission in the stock market that is paid to brokers.

### The Internet and Changing Organizational Boundaries: A Revolution in Interaction

Minimizing costs is one important principle that all organizations need to follow. It is useful to examine the appropriateness of organizational designs from a cost and efficiency perspective.

To make a clear boundary between the organization and their market, the costs to an organization can be divided into two main categories:

+ Transaction costs of arranging and coordinating exchanges.
+ Transformation costs of production and delivery.

Generally, transaction costs can be lower inside organizations because the organization could use administrative tools to minimize and eliminate some of the associated costs with transactions.

One of the main reasons is the scale economy, where suppliers can get materials more cheaply through bulk purchases, and they have more expertise in a specific field or service. For example, car manufacturing and tires.

Transaction costs can be calculated by comparing the total cost of transaction and transformation within its boundary for a component or service, with the total costs of the transaction and transformation for the same component or service from outside its boundary.

If the component or service can be managed internally, then the associated activities should be part of the organization’s hierarchy and they should be managed within its boundary. And vice versa.

The structure of the organization and industry at a given time is designed to minimize the total costs of transformation and transaction, which sets the boundary between the organization and its market.

### Changing Cost Structure of Industries

According to Moore's and Gilder's laws, when the costs of computing and telecommunications decrease and the capacity increases, this development leads to:

+ Revolution in our society and economy.
+ Deep implications for organizational designs and industrial structures, consumer behavior, an organization's strategies, and business models.

The methods that can be affected include communication channels such as phone calls, problem-solving sessions, reports, and memos to enable the exchange of goods, services, and ideas.

### Interactions and Their Costs

Interactions are not free, and in fact, they are very expensive.

At the economy level, the [McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare/our-insights/putting-the-right-price-on-customer-interactions) study found that in the USA, interactions represent a significant percentage of all labor activities. Even in developing countries, the figure is still high.

At an industry level, interactions account for over half of all labor activities in services and a significant portion in mining, agriculture, and manufacturing.

At the firm level, interactions make up a large part of an individual firm’s activities, particularly in the USA.

At the individual level, managers and supervisors spend over half of their time in interactions.

Many of the costs associated with interactions can be classified under transaction costs, as opposed to transformation or production costs.

### Changing Cost Structure of Industries

Interaction costs are lower when production occurs within the boundary of the organization, while transformation costs are lower for specialist outside suppliers.

The decision to make or buy a particular component or service depends on the total cost of transformation and interaction associated with it.

Moore and Gilder predicted that with the rapid development of technologies, the capacity to interact would increase significantly, and the cost associated with interactions would decrease dramatically.

Reducing the transaction costs in many activities means that the cost structures of industries and organizations are being refined significantly, which can reduce transformation costs.

This gives rise to emerging integrated business models, leading to the emergence of virtual organizations in a wide range of industries.

The implication of the revolution in interaction goes far beyond organizational boundaries and industrial structures. Customers’ behavior will also change. The more they search the market, the more likely they will be to locate a supplier that could provide the product of the same quality at lower costs.

### Deconstruction of the Integrated Business Model

The changing cost structure of organizations and industries has put pressure on organizations to focus on their core competencies and outsource quality to stay in the market.

This has resulted in the integrated business model in many industries.

For most organizations, their activities can be classified into the following three categories, each illustrating the nature of the activities they actually do:

- Customer relationship management
- Product innovation and marketing
- Infrastructure management

These activities have very different features and require different styles of organization and management. 

When combined together in one organization, none of these activities can operate at the optimum level.

The customer relationship management is scope-driven—i.e., each customer should be treated as an individual, and the offerings the organization provides should match the requirements of the customer.

Product innovation and marketing are focused on innovating quickly and getting the innovations to market as quickly as possible.

Infrastructure management is driven by scale—full utilization of capacity and increased throughput as far as possible.

With the rapid development of computing and telecommunications, interaction costs have been reduced significantly both within and between organizations. Organizations are increasingly reassessing the situation to determine if this is still the most efficient business model.

Many organizations are increasingly outsourcing strategic activities from specialist suppliers, such as the whole or part of the IT, accounting, or human resource functions. This is known as strategic outsourcing.

### Virtual vs. Vertically Integrated Organizations

Several unrelated things are named as virtual organizations. A virtual organization shares its resources to achieve a common goal.

In vertically integrated organizations, all partners produce different products/services, and products can be combined to produce a common need.

### When is Virtual Virtuous?

Cost is only one of the factors that organizations consider when making strategic decisions on organizational boundaries and strategic focuses.

The success of virtual organizations requires all partners to work towards a common goal, but it is not uncommon for each party to act in its own self-interest at the expense of others.

It is very important to be clear about the circumstances under which the virtual organization is more suitable than vertical integration, and vice versa. One important factor to consider is the nature of the activities. There are two kinds of innovation:

- Independent innovations that can be pursued independently and supplied to multiple buyers.
- Systemic innovations where benefits depend on related innovations in different areas.

### General Implications

In this chapter, the links between the development of the Internet and related technologies and changes in organizational boundaries and industrial structures were examined. From the perspective of transaction cost economics, this chapter illustrated the changing cost structure in many industries as a result of the ongoing revolution in interactions associated with the rapid development of the Internet.

The implications are very profound. All organizations need to:

- Consider alternative configurations of their structures and boundaries, explore new business models, new organizational designs, and new inter-organizational relations.
- Take into account changes in customer behaviors with the collapsing of interaction and information searching costs and the growing transparency of the market.

The transaction cost analysis revealed the cost pressure on all organizations to contract with outsource an increasing range of activities and to unbundle their core activities.

However, it should also be noted that cost is only one of many factors an organization should consider when making strategic decisions, and there are circumstances when outsourcing is exactly the wrong option. Even though such new business models and organizational designs could lead to reduced costs in many organizations and industries, the changing business environment (rapid development and proliferation of ICTs in general, and internet and related technologies in particular) requires all organizations to re-evaluate their strategies, business models, and organizational designs, among many other issues.
