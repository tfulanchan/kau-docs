### Introduction 

The new business environment has changed in several important aspects. This change requires organizations to adopt new strategies, business models, and organizational designs, develop new ways of doing business, and manage disruptive innovations effectively.

This chapter first illustrates the web strategy developed by Hagel and colleagues and explores its implications for today's organizations in the knowledge-based, network economy.

Following this, the chapter examines the deconstruction of value chains, integrated business models, and how this might be done.

Finally, the chapter discusses the qualities and potential difficulties that virtual organizations face.

### Web Strategy, Business Unbundling, and Virtual Organization 

The business environment is very different from the past, and under some circumstances, new strategies and business models are needed for organizations to compete effectively today. These new strategies and business models are closely linked to some of the new rules of the network economy discussed in Chapter 4. 

The changing business environment requires both old and new organizations to develop new strategies and business models.

One such strategy that has emerged in recent years is the so-called 'web strategy.'

The web here refers to 'clusters of companies that collaborate on a particular technology.'

The concept of the 'web' overlaps with another popular concept in the studies of innovation: 'clusters', but clusters usually have a strong geographical connotation.

Webs are primarily concerned with technological standards, customers, or market segments.

Hagel regards the web as a natural response to uncertainty and risks in the environment.

Webs create powerful new ways to think about strategy, risk, technological uncertainty, and innovation.

Different from traditional strategic or supply chains, the web explains how independent companies cluster around particular technological standards or customer segments to deliver complex value propositions to the final consumers.

### New Strategies for the Network Economy

This strategy requires business executives to re-evaluate their management focus, organizational structure, performance measurement, and information systems.

The web strategy also highlights the profound significance of virtual organizations in the new economy.

A virtual organization is unlike the web strategy.

The virtual organization illustrates situations where a cluster of independent companies collaborate to execute a project traditionally managed by large integrated organizations.

The relationships between the partners of the virtual organization could be strategic unions or other formal contracts. This allows independent companies to collaborate and compete with larger, vertically integrated organizations.

An important process that links the web strategy and virtual organization is the deconstruction of integrated business processes and organizational models.

Deconstruction is an effective mechanism that enables the web to grow rapidly. It increasingly leads to the development of virtual organizations in many sectors.

### The Web Strategy

Hagel defined webs as clusters of companies collaborating around a particular technology.

Examples of webs include the Microsoft-Intel platform, SAP integrated IT solutions, Netscape, and the Sony PlayStation.

The webs create a platform where each company can mobilize the support of other companies to achieve their own objectives.

There are many different types of webs, such as the economic web, the technological web, the value web, the customer web, and the market web.

### Classification of the Web 

An economic web is **a cluster of companies that use a common architecture to deliver independent elements of an overall value proposition to final consumers**.

One example of an economic web is the Microsoft and Intel personal computer web—the Wintel web.

Within the web, independent companies combine to deliver the overall value proposition of a Windows PC. 

The members of the web are independent companies, and very often they don’t know—indeed, do not even need to know—most other members of the web.

All companies in the web are totally independent: they price, market, and sell their products autonomously.

It is the pursuit of economic self-interest that brings them together into the web.

Rarely does any partner need to develop formal relations with the other participants.

A technology web is where **a cluster of independent companies organize around a particular technological platform**.

The development of the Internet and related technologies allows a growing number of industries to unbundle their vertically integrated business models to allow specialized, independent players to enter the market.

Example: online services.

Unbundling has created more than virtual organizations.

Because the providers of various services are independent and they provide their services to multiple buyers, many of these buyers could be competitors. This is the technology web.

A value web operates within the technology web and focuses on maximizing value to the customer.

The value web focuses on **creating value for a specific group of companies that have adopted a common technology platform**.

Examples are the value webs in the desktop-computing technology web: Apple’s Macintosh vs. the PC by Microsoft and Intel.

Two types of webs are emerging: the customer web and the market web.

The customer web focuses on **managing the ownership of customer relationships and customer segments**.

By developing and maintaining deep relationships with a particular segment of customers,

a company can use special relationships and deep understanding to serve a wide range of their needs by finding and delivering the most suitable products and services they need from the market, thereby maximally satisfying each customer.

Similarly, a market web focuses on a specific type of transaction by **developing deep relationships for a particular need with all customers**.

For example, a portal for mortgages is the focal point of a market web.

Hagel illustrated two conditions that must be present before an economic web can form:

First, a technological standard and increasing returns. When competing technology standards exist in a market,

a common standard reduces risk by allowing companies to make investment decisions in the face of technological uncertainty.

A technological standard provides the stability and safety net for firms to make dedicated investments; those who own or control the standard can often extract disproportionate rewards from it.

### Two Conditions of an Economic Web

A company often has to take huge risks when selecting which standard to follow. Once the decision is made, it often cannot go back, so following the wrong standard could be costly and strategically damaging to the company.

This is why some companies give away their core technologies and products to boost widespread adoption by users.

The second condition of an economic web is increasing returns, which creates a shared dependence that supports the web by drawing in more customers and producers.

This creates virtuous contributions, such as a positive feedback loop, drawing in ever more companies and consumers, and increasing the size of the whole market exponentially.

The result is increasing returns for everyone within the web when more people join. The more valuable it is to stay in the web, the more people it could attract.

The web has several key characteristics.

Webs are not only unions (associations) because very often there is no formal relationship between the majority of participants.

Each company in a web is largely independent, and their behaviors are driven by the pursuit of economic self-interest.

From a theoretical perspective, they operate separately in the market, including setting prices, marketing, and selling their products and services.

Many of the companies work aggressively with one another.

Webs are natural responses to risk and uncertainty in the environment, according to Hagel.

The safety net of the web allows a firm to focus on activities that offer unique value.

The standards of web strategy ensure that the products and services offered by one company can be fundamental to another company's infrastructure.

As a result, increasing returns will attract more and more companies and customers into the web, thereby enabling continued growth.

Therefore, the web strategy is:

- Reducing the overall investment requirements for a company to enter the market,
- Allowing the company to focus investments on areas most likely to succeed.

### Roles for Different Players in a Web: Shapers and Adapters

A company can perform one of two roles in a web: a shaper or an adapter.

Each role can potentially create substantial value, but the strategies they need to pursue differ significantly.

For **shapers**, the central task is to **define and influence the environment to enhance their ability to create value**.

**Adapters** focus on staying ahead of the competition by **anticipating and responding to environmental changes quickly**.

To illustrate the differences, we can examine the strategies of Microsoft and Dell in the desktop computing web.

As a leading shaper of this web, Microsoft has concentrated on controlling and developing key technologies and relationships in the computer arena and using these positions to shape the web.

Microsoft managed to establish MS-DOS, and then Windows, as the de facto operating system for PCs around the world.

Its strategic alliance with Intel further strengthened its architectural leadership and facilitated standard adoption.

For Microsoft, its huge profit and market value have been derived from the overall architecture rather than the features and attributes of individual products.

As a result, Microsoft's technology focus has always straddled product and architecture, so its long-term investment strategy is to strengthen the architecture and the web.

In contrast, Dell's desktop business has followed a very different strategy. Its focus is to use its low-cost business model to offer customized products at a low price and high quality.

Unlike Microsoft, Dell's success depends on its ability to exploit near-term product opportunities in the Microsoft/Intel value web.

Its marketing has focused on product excellence and customization, low cost, and comprehensive service, rather than trying to define new standards or create a new architecture to challenge Microsoft's Windows.

### Shapers’ Conditions

The ownership of a key platform technology is essential, which shapes the broader architecture and provides long-term lock-in of other participants in the web.

Shapers also need to unbundle their businesses to release profitable opportunities for other web participants, attracting companies to enter the web and create opportunities for increasing income.

For the shaper, owning a smaller or larger slice will help to increase financial profit and control.

Their strategic focus needs to go far beyond the organization's own boundary because their success depends not only on how efficient or innovative they are internally but also, more importantly, on how successful the web is.

By speeding up the adoption of core technologies and expanding the range of web participants, an adapter can be successful.

Early participation in a value web is essential for establishing pre-emptive positions in attractive markets.

The adapter must pursue market shares in the value web through aggressive competition and strengthen relationships with the key shapers for information on the latest developments.

Strategically, they could link their own strategies with key shapers or include several competing webs, although the latter can be expensive and often requires large scales.

For example, a games company could develop games for multiple platforms, but there are serious cost and skill implications.

### The Implications of the Web Strategy

The implications of the web strategy are profound.

It creates powerful new ways to think about strategy, risk, technological uncertainty, and innovation.

It allows companies to manage risk and generate innovation in today’s complex, rapidly changing environment.

#### Reduce Risk

The web strategy enables companies to reduce risks by focusing on what they are good at.

It increases flexibility, reduces the overall investment required by each company, and lowers the barriers to entry.

It reduces risks for all participants in the web because if one company fails, multiple companies can take its place.

#### Encourage Innovation

This mechanism encourages multiple entries in bottleneck areas or in areas employed by companies without unique capabilities.

It provides opportunities for innovative companies to succeed.

#### Encourages Competition

The web encourages innovation because information is distributed far more widely than in a physical marketplace.

This serves to improve functionality, service, and customer adoption.

Management requires a new way of thinking about strategy, industry structure, relationships between companies, and value creation.

Traditionally, a firm creates its own strategy and then negotiates alliances in the market to advance its strategy.

In the web, management first needs to decide which web to enter and what role it should play, and then formulate a strategy for the firm.

The performance measurement of business executives in shapers needs to be similar to physical firm performance as the web performance.

More recently, business unbundling and outsourcing have been pointed out carefully from reliable, competent suppliers.

The information system of the firm often needs to extend beyond its own boundary to enhance communications and information sharing along the entire supply chain.

The internet makes communication easy and affordable.

Many issues remain unanswered.

The web strategy requires organizations to adopt a flexible organizational design, outsource non-strategic activities, and increasingly give rise to the emergence of virtual organizations and new inter-organizational relations.

However, it remains unclear:

+ How unbundling can take place, and under what conditions a virtual organization should be adopted instead of vertical integration.

### What Does Your Company Really Do?

Whenever I ask senior business executives and MBA students this simple question, the answers are always very specific (investment, provide service, sell products).

Stepping back from the sectoral details of these businesses, the nature of the activities that all organizations do is much simpler:

+ The customer relationship business
+ The product innovation and commercialization business
+ The infrastructure management business

Most organizations' activities can be assigned to one of the three categories listed above, although the make-up of some organizations tends to lean more heavily towards some of these activities than others.

Such an organizational composition is a major problem for many organizations in today's business environment. Why? Because these three businesses have very different characteristics, and each of them requires very different strategies, business models, organizational structures, and processes to function efficiently and effectively.

#### customer relations business

The customer relations business is driven by economies of scope. Each customer should be treated as an individual, and the offerings to each customer—as far as possible—modified to maximally satisfy their needs. The organization must focus efforts on customization, developing relationships with customers, and understanding their individual needs. The company should offer as many choices as possible to maximize selection for customers. The objective is to offer appropriate products and services in order to capture a large share of customers' spending.

#### product innovation and commercialization business

The product innovation and commercialization business is driven by speed—the faster an organization can innovate and commercialize new products and services, the better. This requires the organization to use all possible distribution channels to reach potential customers. The organizational culture needs to focus on attracting and retaining creative talents. The operations need to be appropriate to serve the needs of these creative talents for innovation. In other words, the product innovation and commercialization business requires very different strategies, organizational culture, and operational systems from the customer relations business.

#### infrastructure management business

The infrastructure management business is driven by economies of scale. The organization should use the infrastructure to deliver as many products as possible, as fast as possible, and at the lowest costs. The strategic focus is on the full utilization of facilities and low-cost operations, so the organization needs to be oriented towards cost reduction and standardization.

### Unbundling the Unnaturally Bundled Corporations

Each activity has different characteristics, requires very different strategies, business models, organizational structures, and processes, and most of all, different organizational cultures to function efficiently and effectively. Managing them within one organization means that a compromise has to be reached, and despite various other potential benefits, none of them can operate optimally.

The different characteristics of the three businesses unnaturally bundled together within the same organization can create serious problems for each of them.

#### In Customer Relationship Business (e.g., banks)

No bank could possibly provide the 'best products' in all categories. This creates a dilemma for the financial advisor in the bank. The moral of the story is that even if the customer relations management staff (the financial advisors) want to do a good job (that is, providing what is best for the customer), they cannot do so as long as they are part of an integrated bank. They have to sell all products from their own bank even though some of the products are not the best options for the customer. In contrast, a specialized customer service company could search the entire market and find the best-in-class products from multiple suppliers in each of the categories, and then bundle them together to maximally satisfy the needs of a customer. So for customer services, the integrated company cannot possibly compete with a specialist provider.

#### In Product Innovation and Commercialization

The integrated company, once they have invested in producing a product, will need to recover the investment over a certain period of time and extract as much profit from it as possible. If halfway through an investment cycle a newer and better product is invented, it may well be in the company's interest not to commercialize the new product too quickly, in case it cannibalizes the existing product and the investment already made in the existing product cannot be recovered. In comparison, for a product innovation and commercialization company, the consideration will be very different and they will explore different routes to market and commercialize the product as quickly as possible.

#### In Infrastructure Management Business

The driving force is scale—the more products that can be pumped through the infrastructure, the more quickly the organization can recover its investment and make a profit. However, being part of an integrated business will restrict what can and cannot be delivered through the infrastructure. For example, the cash machine networks (Automated Teller Machine or ATM) in the UK require huge investment to develop and maintain, and for most banks, it is a service they have to provide to customers, and often it is not a profitable activity. However, if the network can be detached from banks, the infrastructure can be used to deliver more than cash, and it can also be used to provide a range of other services, for example, selling theatre or football tickets, and so on, thereby generating additional revenues for its providers. This may enable the ATM network to become a stand-alone, profitable business.

The implications are very profound. Since then, large companies have spent considerable energy and resources re-engineering and redesigning their core processes. They have used the latest ICTs to eliminate human intervention, cut waiting time, and reduce errors. For many companies, streamlining core processes has yielded impressive gains, saving money and time, and providing customers with more valuable products and services. However, there are limits to such gains. The principles governing the three core processes conflict with one another. Bundling them into a single corporation inevitably forces management to compromise the performance of each process in ways that no amount of re-engineering can overcome.

In the past, when transaction costs were high, and sometimes for other strategic reasons, these activities were bundled together under the same organizational roof and managed via vertically integrated business models and organizational designs. However, the conditions today have changed, and it often makes more sense to unbundle them and run each of the three activities as stand-alone businesses. Examining the fundamental nature of the business provides one way to deconstruct the vertically integrated business model and processes.

Transaction cost pressures may also influence some organizations to choose not to unbundle. Hagel and Singer believed that **only product innovation is likely to be dominated by a large number of small companies** because of the need for creativity, which favors smaller companies. The other two businesses—customer relations management and infrastructure management—are likely to consolidate quickly and be dominated by a small number of large companies.

A second wave of unbundling for transforming intensive companies is 'unbundling the unbundled.' Most basic capital-intensive services were heavily regulated and/or owned by the country. Such services were mostly delivered by monopolies (single supplier). Examples include gas, electricity, water, telecommunication, and other utilities. Since deregulation, most of these services have been privatized, and the previous services have been unbundled into separate businesses. An example of this is the gas business, where the ownership of the pipeline is separated from the business of pipeline operation, maintenance, and upgrading, and the business of day-to-day work. The unbundling of vertical business has led to significant improvements and innovative efficiency. This was largely achieved by introducing competition into those stages of the value chain and separating ownership, management, and service delivery.

### When is Virtual Worthy?

Managers and academics alike are increasingly convinced that bureaucracy is bad and flexibility is good.

Virtual organizations require less investment and are more responsive to market changes than integrated companies. Therefore, they are more suited for today's volatile business environment.

Despite repeated warnings about the potential risks of the virtual organization since the mid-1990s, managers are still urged to subcontract everything possible today through downsizing, decentralization, alliances, and more recently, strategic and operational outsourcing.

Virtual organizations have many advantages. According to Chesbrough and Teece, **the keys to the success of virtual organizations are incentives and responsiveness**. Rather than relying on administrative measures of the hierarchy to deploy resources and set priorities, virtual organizations use market entities to bring free agents together to buy and sell goods and services.

### When is Virtual Virtuous?

Virtual organizations develop, manufacture, market, distribute, and support integrated solutions for the final consumers in ways that integrated companies could not.

All the smartest people in the world work for them, so the market gives organizations access to such talents when required. In other words, virtual organizations encourage innovation and risk-taking.

These networks can be more sensitive, innovative, and responsive to market changes than integrated companies.

The problem is that great motivations could lead to excessive risk-taking by some of the free agents. When some of them fail, the entire network can be pulled down with them.

Free agents are independent and work for their own self-interest, often at the expense of others. Furthermore, many of these unions will take a short-term view, and therefore, there is also the risk of friendly partnerships becoming long-term unhealthy.

#### Virtual organization characteristics

Often working with little inefficiency out of the system, some partners prefer the system's flexibility to face potential distractions and market changes. When the market changes direction suddenly, the whole network often collapses.

In contrast, integrated companies depend on internal administrative measures to coordinate activities, control resources, and set priorities. Within integrated organizations, it is possible for some sections to make local sacrifices for the benefit of the whole organization.

Chesbrough and Teece point out the virtual organization and the integrated company as two extremes; in the middle are various alliances. The key is to strike an appropriate balance between incentive and control, which depends on the nature of the innovation the organization is pursuing.

### Autonomous versus Systemic Innovations

There are two types of innovation:

1. Innovations that can be followed up independently, such as turbochargers for cars.
2. Innovations that must be followed up collaboratively, where no one can work without the other, such as photography, which depends on perfect camera technologies with film technologies.

When innovations are autonomous, virtual organizations can manage the development and commercialization of the innovation very well. When the innovation is systemic, integrated organizations are often more appropriate because the organization does not need to work with independent partners whom they have no control over.

It should also be noted that all innovations depend critically on information flows. Codified (collected) information can travel relatively easily between organizations (such as the information in an industry field). Tacit knowledge is deeply embedded in an organization and does not travel across organizational boundaries easily. Systemic innovation often requires tacit information, and it is often easier to coordinate the exchange of such information within the boundary of an organization.

### The Rise and Fall of IBM

The success and failure of virtual organizations were clearly illustrated by the rise and fall of IBM since the 1980s. Under threat from aggressive advances by Apple, IBM launched its first PC in 1981. Rather than developing its own technologies, IBM chose to outsource all major components from the market: microprocessors were purchased from Intel, and the operating system was licensed from Microsoft. The PC was based on a standard and components that were widely available on the market.

This enabled hundreds of third-party developers of software and hardware to join the fray. IBM also relied on third parties to distribute its products. This greatly reduced the time and investment required, and they were able to bring the product to market in months.

This approach brought clear early success to IBM, and by 1984, IBM replaced Apple as the number one supplier of PCs with a market share of 26 percent, which further grew to 41 percent.

However, the early success soon collapsed because IBM lost control of the IT architecture it created. Competitors were able to buy the same components, license the same operating system and application software, and use the same distribution channels, leaving IBM with little to establish competitive advantages.

When IBM tried to regain control of the architecture by launching its own OS/2 operating system, Microsoft introduced a competing system, Windows, which was backward compatible with the old operating system, DOS. Compaq was also able to work with Intel to launch the first 386 'PC clone' before IBM. By 1995, IBM's PC market share had been reduced to a mere 7.3%, against Compaq's 10.5%.

In 2005, the IBM PC was sold to China's Lenovo. However, IBM did help create some super-rich companies in the industry such as Intel, Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard, and Dell.

### Main Lessons

The moral of the story is that a company should not outsource everything. Without core competences and strong internal strength, strategic positions in a virtual network are often short-lived. The virtual organization is only effective under particular circumstances.

For most organizations, especially large organizations, achieving the balance between a mixture of internal development capabilities, licenses, partnerships, and alliances, and new technologies purchased from other companies is essential to their long-term competitiveness and survival. Without control over key technologies, relationships, internal capability, and market-led virtual networks often do not work. This is particularly crucial for a firm to shape the market.

A further lesson is that organizations need to evaluate a new strategy and business model over different time scales. The right balance between long-term opportunities and short-term gains is very important. Too short a time horizon in evaluating new strategies and business models is dangerous.

Equally dangerous is the decentralization and outsourcing of key activities and technologies without strategic leverage, central coordination and control over the relationship and the provider.

Virtual organizations have many advantages over integrated companies under certain circumstances. If implemented properly, the critical issue is to identify the right circumstances, the activities to unbundle or outsource from the market, and execute the strategy effectively.

### Summary

In the context of the changing business environment and the new rules of the networked, knowledge-based economy, this chapter illustrated one set of emerging strategies and business models.

The web strategy represents a powerful new way to think about strategy, risk, technological uncertainty, and innovation. It encourages business executives to re-evaluate their management focus, organizational structure, performance measurement, and information systems. It highlights the critical importance of standards in today's business environment, and once standards are established, it requires organizations to unbundle integrated business models and processes in order to release opportunities for other companies and grow the market rapidly.

However, virtual organizations point out new challenges to business executives. Under specific circumstances, the virtual organization is very effective in providing the resources and competence of independent companies in the market to deliver integrated solutions to customers. It is more responsive and flexible than many of the vertically integrated companies in responding to market changes.
