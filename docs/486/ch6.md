Introduction 

The new business environment has changed inseveral important aspects, this change requires organizations toadopt new strategies, business models and new organizational designs, develop new ways of doing business and manage disruptive innovations effectively


This chapter first illustrates the web strategy that developed byHagel and colleagues, and explores its implications fortoday's organizations in the knowledge-based, network economy.

Following this, the chapter examines the deconstruction ofvalue chains, integrated business models, and how this might bedone.

Finally the chapter discusses the qualities and potential difficulties that face virtual organization 

### Web Strategy, Business Unbundling, and Virtual Organization 

The business environment is very different from the past, and under some circumstances new strategies and business models are needed for organizations tocompete effectively today. These new strategies and business models are closely linked to some of the new rules of the network economy discussed in chapter. 

The changing business environment requires organizations old and new todevelop new strategies and business models.

One such strategy that has emerged inrecent years istheso-called 'web strategy',

The web here is the web refers to'clusters of companies that collaborate on aparticular technology'.
 
The concept ofthe 'web' overlaps with another popular concept inthe studies of innovation-'clusters', but clusters usually have astrong geographical connotation.

webs are primarily concerned with technological standards, customer, ormarket segments.

Hagel regards the web as a Natural response to uncertainty and risks in environmental,

Webs create powerful new ways tothink about strategy, risk, technological uncertainty and innovation.

Different from traditional strategic or supply chains, the web explains how independent companies cluster around particular technological standards orcustomer segments todeliver complex value propositions to the final consumers.

New Strategies for the Network Economy

This strategy requires business executives to reevaluate their management focus, organizational structure, performance measurement, and information systems,

The web strategy also highlights the profound significance ofvirtual organizations in the new economy.

New Strategies for the Network Economy
 
Virtual organization is unlike web strategy,

The virtual organization illustrates situations where a cluster of independent companies active with each other to execute aproject traditionally only manageable by large integrated organizations.

The relationships between the partners ofthe virtual organizations could bestrategic unions or other formal contracts.This allows independent tocollaborate and compete with larger, vertically integrated organizations.

New Strategies for the Network Economy
 
An important process that links the web strategy and virtual organization is the deconstruction of integrated business processes and organizational models.

Deconstruction isaneffective mechanism that enables the web togrow rapidly, it is increasingly leading to the development of virtual organizations in many sectors.

New Strategies for the Network  Economy
 
The Web Strategy

Hagel defined webs asclusters ofcompanies collaborating around aparticular technology.

Examples of webs is the Microsoft Intel platform, SAP integrated IT solutions, Netscape and the Sony PlayStation.

The webs create platform foreach company can mobilizes and support ofother companies to achieve their own objectives.

There are many different types of web, such as economic web, the technological and the value web, the customer web and the market web.

The Web Strategy

Classification of the Web 

Economic web is a cluster of companies that use a common architecture to deliver independent elements ofanoverall value proposition tofinal consumers.

One example of an economic web is the Microsoft and Intel personal computer web-the Wintel web.

Within the web, independent companies combine to deliver theoverall value proposition ofaWindows PC.

The Web Strategy

Classification of the Web 

The members ofthe web are independent companies, and very often they don’t know- indeed, donoteven need to know-most other members oftheweb

All companies in the web aretotally independent: they price, market and sell their products autonomously.

It is the pursuit of economic self-interest that brings them together intotheweb.

It is rarely any partner needs todevelop aformal relations with the other participants.

The Web Strategy Classification of the Web 

Technology web, where acluster ofindependent companies organize around aparticular technological platform.

The development of the Internet and related technologies allows a growing number of industries to unbundle their vertically integrated business models toallow specialized, independent players toenter the market.

Example ;online service

The Web Strategy Classification of the Web 

Unbundling has created more than virtual organizations,

Because theproviders of various services areindependent and they provide their services to multiple buyers, and
many ofthese buyers could be competitors. To do technology web.

The Web Strategy Classification of the Web 

Value web.

It operates within thetechnology web and the technology web focuses onmaximizing value tothecustomer.

The value Web focus oncreating value for a specific group ofcompanies that have adopted a common technology platform.

Examples are the value webs inthe desktop-computing technology web. Apple’s Macintosh vs. the PC by Microsoft and Intel

The Web Strategy
Classification of the Web 

Two types Ofweb are emerging which are customer web and themarket web,

The customer web focuses

On managing theownership ofcustomer relationships and customer segments.

By developing and maintaining deep relationships with a particular segment ofcustomers,

A company could use special relationship and deep understanding toserve awide range oftheir needs by finding and delivering the most suitable products and services they need from themarket and maximally satisfy each customer.

The Web Strategy
Classification of the Web 

Similarly, a market web

Focuses onaspecific type oftransaction bydeveloping deep relationships foraparticular need with all customers.

Example, aportal formortgages isthefocal point ofa market web.

Hagel illustrated two conditions that must be present before aneconomic web

First Conduction is a technological standard and increasing returns, When competing technology standards exist in a market,

A common standard reduces riskbyallowing companies tomake investment decisions intheface oftechnological
uncertainty.

A technological standard provides thestability and safety net for firms to make dedicated investments; and those who own orcontrol the standard can often extract disproportionate reward from it.

The Web Strategy
two conditions of an economic web

A company often has to take huge risks when selecting which standard to follow ;

Once the decision is made, it often cannot go back. So following the wrong standard could be costly and strategically damaging to the company.

Why some companies give away their core technologies and products toboost widespread adoption by users;

The Web Strategy
two conditions of an economic web

The second condition of an economic web is increasing returns,

Which creates ashared dependence that supports the web bydrawing inmore customers and producers.

This creates avirtuous contributions such asapositive feedback loop, drawing inever more companies and
consumers, and increasing thesize ofthewhole market exponentially.

The result is increasing returns for everyone within the web when more people join theweb.More valuable is to stay in the web which could attract more people.
 
The Web Strategy two conditions of an economic web


The web has several key characteristics.

Webs are notonly union (association), because very often there isnoformal relationship between the majority of participants.

Each company inaweb

Is largely independent and their behaviors are driven by the pursuit ofeconomic self-interest.

From theory perspective, they operate separately inthe market including setting prices, marketing and selling
their products and services.

The Web Strategy Characteristic of the Web

The Web Strategy Characteristic of the Web


Many of the companies working aggressively with one toanother.

Webs arenatural responses toriskand uncertainty environment according toHagel.

The safety net of the web allows a firm:

To focus on activities that offer unique value

The standards ofweb strategy ensure theproducts and services that offered byone company can be as fundamental of another companies infrastructure.


As a result, increasing returns will lead toattract more and more companies and customers intothe web. thereby enabling continued growth.

Therefore, theweb Strategy is:

Reducing the overall investment requirements by a company toenter themarket,

Allowing thecompany tofocus investments onareas most likely tosucceed.


The Web Strategy
Characteristic of the Web

Roles for different players in a web: shapers and adapters

Acompany can perform one of two roles in a web: ashaper oranadapter.

Each role can potentially create substantial value but the strategies need topursue they have to
adopt differ significantly.

For shapers, the central task istodefine and influence the environment in order to enhance their ability tocreate value.

Adapters focus onstaying ahead ofcompetition byanticipating and responding to environmental changes quickly.

Roles for different players in a web: shapers and adapters

To illustrate the differences we can examine the strategies of Microsoft and Dell in the desktop computing web.

As a leading shaper of this web. Microsoft has concentrated on

Controlling and developing key technologies and relationships inthe computer arena and using these positions toshape theweb.

Microsoft managed toestablish MS-DOS, and then Windows, asthedefacto operating system forPCsaround
the world.

Roles for different players in a web: shapers and adapters

Its strategic alliance with Intel further strengthened
itsarchitectural leadership and facilitated standard
adoption.

For Microsoft, itshuge profit and market value
have been derived from theoverall architecture
rather than features and attributes ofindividual
products.

Asaresult, Microsoft's technology focus has
always straddled product and architecture, soits
long-term investment strategy istostrengthen the
architecture and theweb.

Roles for different players in a 
web: shapers and adapters

Incontrast, Dell's desktop business has followed a
very different strategy. Itsfocus istouseitslow-cost
business model tooffer customized products ata
lowprice and high quality.

Unlike Microsoft, Dell's success depends onits
ability toexploit near-term product opportunities in
theMicrosoft/Intel value web.

Itsmarketing has focused onproduct excellence
and customization, low cost and comprehensive
service, rather than trying todefine new standards
orcreate anew architecture tochallenging
Microsoft's Windows.

Roles for different players in a 
web Shapers ’ Condition

the ownership ofakey platform technology is
essential, which shapes the broader architecture
and provides long-term lock-in ofother participants
intheweb.

Theshapers also need tounbundle their businesses
torelease profitable opportunities forother web

web and create opportunities forincreasing income

Itsstrategic focus needs togofarbeyond the
organization's own boundary, because itssuccess
depends notonly onhow efficient orinnovative itis
internally, but also, more importantly, onhow
successful theweb is.

Roles for different players in a 
web Adapters ’ conditions

The adapter must pursue market shares inthe
value web through aggressive competition and
strengthen relationships with the key shapers for
information onthelatest development.

Strategically they could

Link their own strategies with keyshapers or

Include several competing webs, although thelatter can
beexpensive and often requires large scales.

Forexample, agames company could develop games
platforms, butthere areserious cost and skillimplications.

The implications of the web 
strategy

Theimplications oftheweb strategy arevery deep,

Itcreate powerful new ways tothink about strategy,
risk, technological uncertainty, and innovation

Allows companies tomanage risk and generate
innovation intoday’s complex, rapidly changing
environment.


Reduce risk

Itenables companies toreduce risks byfocusing onwhat
they aregood

Increases flexibility and reduce the overall investment
required byeach company and lowers the barriers of
entry.

Reduce risks forallparticipants intheweb because ifone
company fails multiple companies willtake itplace.The implications of the web 
strategy

The implications of the web 
strategy

Encourage Innovation

Thismechanism encourages multiple entries inbottleneck
areas orinareas employed bycompanies without unique
capabilities,

Provide opportunities for innovative companies to
succeed.

Encourages competition

The web encourages innovation because information is
distributed far more widely and than inaphysical
marketplace.

This serves toimprove functionality, service, and
customer adoption.

The implications of the web 
strategy

Management

Itrequire new way ofthinking about strategy, industry
structure, relationships between companies and value
creation.

Traditionally afirm create itsown strategy and then
negotiates alliances inthemarket toadvance itsstrategy.

Intheweb,management firstneeds todecide which web
toenter and what role itshould play, and then formulates
strategy forthefirm.(Opposite)

The performance measurement ofbusiness executives in
shapers needs tosimilar inphysical firmperformance asthe
web performance.

The implications of the web 
strategy

More recently, business unbundling and
outsourcing hasbeen point carefully from reliable,
competent suppliers.

The information system ofthefirm often needs to
extend beyond itsown boundary toenhance
communications and information share along the
entire supply chain.

Theinternet make communication easy and affordable

The implications of the web 
strategy

Many issues remain unanswered.

Theweb strategy requires organizations

Toadopt aflexible organizational design

Outsource non- strategic activities and, increasingly.

Italso gives risetotheemergence ofvirtual organizations
and new inter-organizational relations.

However, itremains unclear (Challenges)

How unbundling can take place,and under what
conditions avirtual organization should be adopted
instead ofvertical integration.

What Does your Company 
really Do?

Whenever Iask senior business executives and
MBA students thissimple question, theanswers are
always very specific, (investment, provide service,
sellproducts)

Stepping back from thesectoral details ofthese
businesses, the nature ofthe activities that all
organizations doismuch simpler.

Thecustomer relationship business

Theproduct innovation and commercialization business

Theinfrastructure management business


Most organizations' activities can beassigned to
one ofthethree categories listed above, although
themake-up ofsome organizations tends tolean
more heavily towards some ofthese activities than
others.

Such anorganizational composition isamajor
problem formany organizations intoday's business
environment. (WHY)

because these three businesses have very different
characteristics and each ofthem requires very different
strategies, business models and organizational structures
and processes tofunction efficiently and effectively.What Does your Company 
really Do?

What Does your Company 
really Do?
Thecustomer relations business

isdriven byeconomies ofscope

Each customer should betreated asanindividual
and the offerings toeach customer-asfaras
possible –modify made tomaximally satisfy their
needs.

the organization must efforts incustomization to
developing relationships with customers and
understanding their individual needs.


The company should offer asmany choices as
possible tomaximize selection forcustomers.

The objective istooffer appropriate product and
services inorder tocapture alarge share of
customers' spending.

The product innovation and commercialization
business

Isdriven byspeed-thefaster anorganization can
innovate and commercialize new products and
services thebetter.What Does your Company 
really Do?

What Does your Company 
really Do?

Thisrequires theorganization

Touse allpossible distribution channels toreach potential
customers

The organizational culture needs towards attracting and
retaining creative talents,

Theoperations need tobeappropriated toserve the
needs ofthese creative talents forinnovation

in other words, the product innovation and
commercialization business requires very different
strategies, organizational culture and operational
systems from thecustomer relations business.

What Does your Company 
really Do?

Theinfrastructure management business

Itisdriven byeconomies ofscale,

The organization should use the infrastructure to
deliver asmany products aspossible, asfast as
possible, and atthelowest costs.

The strategic focus isonthe full utilization of
facilities and low-cost operations, so the
organization require tobeoriented towards cost
reduction and standardization.

Unbundling the Unnaturally 
Bundled Corporations

Each activity

have different characteristics

require very different strategies, business models and
organizational structure and processes

and most ofall, different organizational cultures-to
function efficiently and effectively.

Managing them within one organization means
that acompromise hastobereached, and despite
various other potential benefits, none ofthem can
operate optimally.


Thedifferent characteristics ofthethree businesses
unnaturally bundled together within the same
organization can create serious problems foreach
ofthem.

Incustomer relationship business

Ex.Bank, nobank could possibly provide ‘best products ’in
allcategories.This create adilemma tothe financial
advisor inthebank

Customer relation management vs.specialized
customer service company.Unbundling the Unnaturally 
Bundled Corporations

Unbundling the Unnaturally 
Bundled Corporations

Themoral ofthestory isthat even ifthecustomer
relations management staff (the financial advisers)
want todoagood job(that is,providing what is
best forthecustomer),

They cannot dosoaslong asthey arepart ofan
integrated bank.

They have tosellallproducts from their own bank even
though some oftheproducts arenotthebest options for
thecustomer.


Incontrast, aspecialized customer service
company could search theentire market and

find thebest-in-class products from multiple suppliers in
each ofthecategories, and then bundle them together to
maximally satisfy theneeds ofacustomer.

Soforcustomer services, theintegrated company
cannot possibly compete with aspecialist providerUnbundling the Unnaturally 
Bundled Corporations



The same istrue forproduct innovation and
commercialization. Theintegrated company,

once they have invested inproducing aproduct,

thecompany willneed torecover theinvestment over a
certain period oftime and extract asmuch profit from itas
possible.

Ifhalfway through aninvestment cycle anewer and better
product isinvented, itmay well beinthe company's
interest nottocommercialize thenew product tooquickly,

Incase itcannibalizes the existing product and the
investment already made intheexisting product cannot
berecovered.Unbundling the Unnaturally 
Bundled Corporations


Incomparison, for product innovation and
commercialization company,

the consideration will bevery different and they will
explore different routes tomarket and commercialize the
product asquickly aspossible.

Forinfrastructure management businesses,

Thedriving force isscale themore products that can be
pumped through theinfrastructure themore quickly the
organization can recover itsinvestment and make aprofit.

However, being part ofanintegrated business willrestrict
what can and cannot bedeliver through theinfrastructure.Unbundling the Unnaturally 
Bundled Corporations

Unbundling the Unnaturally 
Bundled Corporations (ATM)

For example, the cash machine networks
Automated Teller Machine (ATM)

IntheUKrequire huge investment todevelop and
maintain,

and formost banks itisaservice they have to
provide tocustomers and often itisaprofitable not
activity.


However, ifthe network can bedetached from
banks,

theinfrastructure can beused todeliver more than cash
and itcan also beused toprovide arange ofother
services

forexample, selling theatre orfootball tickets, and soon,

thereby generating additional revenues foritsproviders.

This may enable theATM network tobecome a
stand-alone, profitable businessUnbundling the Unnaturally 
Bundled Corporations (ATM)

Unbundling the Unnaturally 
Bundled Corporations

Theimplications arevery profound.

Since thes, large companies have spent considerable
energy and resources re-engineering and redesigning their
core processes.

They have used the latest ICTs toeliminate human
intervention, cutwaiting time and reduce errors.

For many companies, streamlining core processes has
yielded impressive gains, saving money and time and
providing customers with more valuable products and
services.


However, there arelimits tosuch gains.

Theprinciples governing thethree core processes conflict
with one another.

Bundling them into asingle corpora tion inevitably forces
management tocompromise the performance ofeach
process inways that noamount ofre-engineering can an
overcome.

Inthepast when transaction costs were high, and
sometimes forother strategic-reasons.

these activities were bundled together under the same
organizational roof and managed viavertically integrated
business models and organizational designs.Unbundling the Unnaturally 
Bundled Corporations

Unbundling the Unnaturally 
Bundled Corporations

However, theconditions today have changed and
itoften makes more sense tounbundle them and
run each ofthe three activities asstand-alone
businesses.

Examining thefundamental nature ofthebusiness provides
one way todeconstruct thevertically integrated business
model and processes

Transaction cost, have also cost pressure, some
organizations may choose nottounbundle.

Unbundling the Unnaturally 
Bundled Corporations

Hagel and Singer believed that only product
innovation islikely tobedominated byalarge
number ofsmall companies because oftheneed
forcreativity, which favors smaller companies.

The other two businesses-customer relations
management and infrastructure management-
are likely toconsolidate (join) quickly and be
dominated byasmall number oflarge companies.

Unbundling the Unbundled

Asecond wave ofunbundling fortransforming
intensive companies is'unbundling theunbundled’.

Most basic capital-intensive services were heavily
regulated and/or owned bythecountry.

Such services were mostly delivered by
monopolies (single supplier)

Examples include gas, electricity, water,
telecommunication and other utilities.

Unbundling the Unbundled

Since deregulation, most ofthese services have been
privatized and the previous service have been
unbundled intoseparated businesses

An example ofthis isthe gas business where the
ownership ofthepipeline isseparated from thebusiness
ofpipeline operation, maintenance and upgrading, and
thebusiness ofday-to-day work.

The unbundling ofvertical business lead tosignificant
improvements and innovated efficiency.

Thiswas largely achieved byintroducing competition into
those stages ofthevalue chain, and separate between
ownership, management and service delivery.

When is Virtual Worthy?

Managers and academics alike are increasingly
convinced that bureaucracy isbad and flexibility is
good.

Virtual organizations

Require less investment, and more responsive tomarket
changes than integrated companies,

Therefore are more suited fortoday's volatile business
environment.


Despite repeated warnings about thepotential risks
ofthevirtual organization since themid-s,

Managers are still urged tosubcontract everything
possible today,

Through downsizing, decentralization, alliances and more
recently, strategic and operational outsourcing.

Virtual organizations have many advantages

According,toChesbrough and Teece, thekeys to
thesuccess ofvirtual organizations are

incentives and responsiveness.Rather than relying on
administrative measures ofthe hierarchy todeploy
resources and setpriorities,
When is Virtual Virtuous?

When is Virtual Virtuous?

Virtual organizations usemarket entities to

Bring free agents together tobuy and sell goods and
services.

Todevelop,manufacture, market, distribute and support
integrated solutions forthefinal consumers inways that the
integrated companies could notdoit.

Allthesmartest people intheworld work forthem, so
themarket gives organizations access tosuch talents
when required.So, Inother words, the virtual organizations encourage toinnovation and risk talking.

These networks can bemore sensitive, innovative and responsive tomarket changes than integrated companies.

When is Virtual Virtuous?

Theproblem isthat great motivations could lead to excessive risktaking bysome ofthefree agents,

When some ofthem fail, theentire network being pulled down with them.

Free agents isindependent and they are working from their own self-interest, often attheexpense ofothers.

Furthermore, many ofthese union willtake a short-term view, and therefore there isalso the risk offriendly partnerships tobeinlong term unhealthy.

When is Virtual Virtuous?

Virtual organization characteristics

Often working little inefficiency outofthesystem, so some partners prefer the system flexibility toface potential distractions and market changing.

When market changes direction suddenly, the whole network often collapsed.

Incontrast, integrated companies

Depending on internal administrative measures to coordinate activities, control resources and setpriorities.

Within integrated organizations itispossible for some sections tomake local sacrifices forthe benefit ofthe whole organization.

When is Virtual Virtuous?

Chesbrough and Teece point out the virtual organization and theintegrated company astwo extremes: inthemiddle arevarious alliances

The key istostrike an appropriate balance between incentive and control, which depends on the nature ofthe innovation the organization is pursuing.

Autonomous versus Systemic 
Innovations

There aretwotypes ofinnovation.
.Innovations that can befollowed upindependently, such as innovation isaturbo chargers forcars.
.Innovation must befollowed upcollaboratively, and no one can work without theother, such asphotography which depends onaperfect camera technologies with film technologies.

When innovations areautonomous, thevirtual organizations can manage the development and commercialization ofthe innovation very well,

When theinnovation issystemic, theinnovation areoften more appropriate because theorganization does notneed towork with independent partners who they have nocontrol.

Autonomous versus systemic  innovations

Itshould also benoted that allinnovations depend critically oninformation flows.

Codified (collected) information can travel relatively easily between organizations (such astheinformation in industry field).

Tacit knowledge isdeeply embedded in an organization and does not travel across organizational boundaries easily.

Systemic innovation often require tacit information, and often easier tocoordinate theexchange ofsuch information within theboundary ofanorganization.

The Rise and Fall of IBM

The success and failure ofvirtual organizations were clearly illustrated bytherise/fall ofIBM since the s.Under threat from aggressive advances by Apple,

IBM launched itsfirstPCin.

Rather than developing itsown technologies. IBM chose tooutsource allmajor components from the market:

microprocessors were purchased from Intel and the operating system licensed from Microsoft. The PC was based onastandard and components that were widely available onthemarket,


This enabled hundreds of third-party developers of software and hardware tojointhefray.

IBM also relied onthird parties todistribute itsproducts.

IBM have done greatly reduced the time and investment required and they was able tobring the product tomarket inmonths.

This approach brought clear early success to IBM. and by,

IBM replaced Apple as the number one supplier of PCs with a market share ofpercent, which further grew to percent.
The Rise and Fall of IBM

The Rise and Fall of IBM

However, the early success was soon collapse because IBM lost control oftheITarchitecture it created.

Competitors were able tobuy the same components, license the same operating system and application software, and usethesame distribution channels.

leaving IBM with little toestablish competitive advantages.

When IBM tried toregain control ofthearchitecture by launching itsown OS/operating system.Microsoft introduced acompeting system, Windows, which was backward compatible with theoldoperating system, DOS

The Rise and Fall of IBM

Compaq was also able towork with Intel tolaunch the first'PCbefore IBM.

By, IBM's PCmarket share had been reduced to a mere.%,against Compaq's. %–

In the IBM, PC was sold to China's Lenova.

However, IBM did help create some super-rich companies inthe industry such as Intel and Microsoft toHewlett-Packard and Dell.

Main Lessons

Themoral ofthestory is that a company should not outsource everything,

Without core competences and strong internal strength, strategic positions invirtual network are often short-lived

The virtual organization isonly effective under particular circumstances.


For most organizations especially the large organizations,

Achieving thebalance isimportant between amixture of internal development capabilities, licenses, partnership and alliances,

New technologies purchased from other companies, is essential totheir long- term competitive and survival. 
Without control over key technologies and relationships, internal capability, market-ledvirtual networks often do not work, isparticularly crucial forafirm toshape the market.

Main Lessons

A further lesson isthat organizations need to evaluate anew strategy anbusiness model over different time scales

Theright balance between long-term opportunities and short-term gains isvery important.

Too short atime horizon inevaluating new strategies and business models isdangerous ;

Equally dangerous isthedecentralization and outsourcing of key activities and technologies without strategic leverage and central coordination and control over the relationship and theprovider

Main Lessons

Virtual organizations have many advantages over integrated companies, under certain circumstances

If implemented properly, thecritical issue is

Toidentify theright circumstances,

Theactivities tounbundle oroutsource from themarket,

Execute thestrategy effectively.

Summary

In the context of the changing business environment and thenew rules ofthenetworked, knowledge-based economy,

This chapter illustrated one set ofemerging strategies and business models.


The web strategy

Represents apowerful new way tothink about strategy, risk, technological uncertainty and innovation

Itencourages business executives tore-evaluate their management focus, organizational structure, performance measurement, and information systems.

Highlights thecritical importance ofstandards intoday's business environment ;and once standards are established, itrequires organizations to unbundle integrated business models and processes inorder to release opportunities forother companies and grow the market rapidly.

Summary

However, virtual organizations point out new challenges tobusiness executives, under specific circumstances,

The virtual organization isvery effective toprovide the resources and competence ofindependent companies in the market todeliver integrated solutions tocustomers,

It is responsive and flexible than many ofthevertically integrated companies inresponding tomarket changes
