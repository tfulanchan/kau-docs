Managing Disruptive Strategic Innovation in the New Economy

Introduction 
+ Disruptive innovations create new markets orreshape
existing markets by
+ delivering relative simple, convenient, lowcost innovations toaset
ofcustomers who areignored byindustry leaders.
+ Since the late  s,avery influential strategic innovation
hasbeen thetheory ofdisruptive strategic innovations.
+ Clayton Christensen ofHarvared Business School in
started thefirst developed theory inhisbestseller book The
Innovator's Dilemma.'Heexplained how industry leaders
that focused onhigh-end products fortheir most profitable
customers can be'blindsided' bydisruptive innovations
from new competitors

Introduction 
+ In.The Innovator's Solution creating and sustaining
successful growth,
+ This established companies how tocreate disruptive innovations
rather than being destroyed bythem,
+ How toturn innovative ideas into new disruptive products that can
lead tolong-term profitable growth.
+ In.another book written with Eric Roth and Scott
Anthony:Seeing What Next:Using theory ofinnovation to
predict industry change,
+ The book describe, summarize, and further developed thedisruptive
theory ofstrategic innovations and supported itwith new evidence
and more detailed explanations.

Introduction
+ The strategy ofdisruption is
+ One ofthemost influential theories inrecent years
+ Itprovides apowerful framework for executives toidentify
emerging opportunities and challenges inthemarket
+ Develop appropriate strategic responses.
+ Itprovides aninsightful explanation toaquestion that has been
puzzling academics, consultants and business executives for
decades:
+ Why dosuccessful companies failtosustain profitable growth
formore than afewyears ?

Introduction
+ According tothis theory, thecompanies failnotbecause the
executives and workers aredoing abad job.Butbecause
+ They have been doing anexcellent jobinwhat they aresupposed to
bedoing
+ Improving products rapidly and continuously
+ Focusing onneeds ofthehigh-end, most profitable customers.

Introduction
+ Theory ofdisruptive innovation isnot specific tothe
knowledge based, network economy.Many disruptive
innovations were introduced indifferent sectors
+ Disruptive strategic innovations are particularly influential-
and disruptive intoday's business environment, because of
the extremely rapid development and widespread
proliferation ofICTs
+ Examples such eBay, Google, Amazon.com, Expedia.
Travelocity and soon.These new entrants have radically
disrupted awide range ofindustries such asauctions, book
retailing toholidays, traveling, and hotel booking.

The Strategy of Disruption-From 
Inventor's Dilemma to Inventor's Solutions
+ Cristensen pointed out that roughly only one company in
every tenisable tosustain thekind ofgrowth
+ Once acompany's core business has matured, itshould
looking fornew platforms forgrowth which have:
+ Include significant risk
+ Most companies simply donotknow how togrow.
+ Following growth with wrong way can make worse than nogrowth
atall.

+ Managers have long sought ways topredict theoutcome of
competition based around innovation,
+ Butithasbecome difficult todosoinrecent years.
+ Itisnolonger simply matter oflarge companies, using their
resources tocrush smaller competitors
+ Tobring incremental changes, and attention toinnovation that
enable them tooutperform thecompetition.
+ Itisthe'circumstances' ofinnovations that often Determine
whether currant industry leaders orupstart companies win
acompetitive war.The Strategy of Disruption-From 
Inventor's Dilemma to Inventor's Solutions

+ New-entrants are more likely toovertake old leaders in
disruptive circumstances,
+ When the challenge istocommercialize asimpler, more
convenient product that sells forless money and attract to
new customers.
+ Established current large companies can capture disruptive
growth, rather than bedefeated it,ifthey aware ofthe
circumstances ofdisruptive innovations and areable touse
itforthem and their own benefit.The Strategy of Disruption-From 
Inventor's Dilemma to Inventor's Solutions

Two types of innovation: 
sustaining versus disruptive innovation
+ Different from the classification of innovations into
autonomous and systemic innovations when examining the
suitability ofdifferent organizational models and designs in
thelast chapter.
+ Christensen classified innovations into two categories along
adifferent dimension:sustaining innovations and
disruptive innovations
+ The nature of the innovation determines whether
established companies ornew entrants eventually win the
competitive war inthemarket.

+ Inevery industry, there isarate ofimprovement in
products that customers canfully utilize oruse.
+ However, inmost industries, the pace oftechnological
progress almost always outstrips theability ofcustomers in
any given tierofthemarket touseit.
+ Partly because companies keep trying tomake better
products that they can sellforhigher profit margins totheir
most demanding, high-end customers.
+ This creates aserious problem forestablished companies
making such productTwo types of innovation: 
sustaining versus disruptive innovation

+ This creates opportunities fornew entrants toenter the
market
+ With products with fewer features and lower specifications,
+ First selling them tocustomers atthelowest market, who theleast
attractive customers toestablished companies,
+ But moving upwards toinclude the high end customers, who are
more profitable customers fortheestablished companiesTwo types of innovation: 
sustaining versus disruptive innovation


Two types of innovation: 
sustaining versus disruptive innovation

+ Asustaining innovation is:
+ Targets those demanding, high-end customers, with better
performance than previously available.Whether performance isan
incremental improvement orabreakthrough improvement.
+ Established companies aremotivated tofocus onfollowing
upinnovations tomeet the needs oftheir high-end, most
profitable customers.
+ This leaves the door open fornew entrants totarget the
low-end customers.Two types of innovation: 
sustaining versus disruptive innovation

+ Disruptive innovations
+ Donot bring better products and services toestablished customers
inexisting markets.
+ Introduce products and services that are not asgood asexisting
products, But which are simpler, more convenient, and less
expensive than existing ones.
+ Asthese simpler products continue toimprove, New
entrants soon getafoothold inthe market, and Gradually
squeeze outtheestablished incumbent suppliers.
+ The history ofthe computing industry inthe past few
decades provides anexample ofthis scenario.Which is
Disruption often breakdown industry-leading companies.Two types of innovation: 
sustaining versus disruptive innovation

Two types of disruption: low-end 
disruption and new market disruption
+ Toidentify where disruptions can take place, animportant
concept used byChristensen Isthevalue network.
+ Christensen defined the value network asaplane of
competition and consumption inwhich theapplication and
customers reside.
+ Inother words, avalue network is'the context within
which afirm establishes acost structure and operating
processes and works with suppliers and channel partners in
order torespond profitably tothecommon needs ofaclass
ofcustomers’

+ Christensen added athird dimension tothe disruptive
innovation model inThe Innovator's Solutions byextending
into new contexts ofconsumption and competition.
+ The new value networks constitute ofnew customers who
previously lacked the money orskills tobuy and use the
product, ordifferent situations inwhich aproduct can be
used.
+ These were made possible byimprovements insimplicity,
portability and costs.Two types of disruption: low-end 
disruption and new market disruption


Two types of disruption: low-end 
disruption and new market disruption

+ New-market disruptions take place indifferent value
networks, by competing with non-consumption By
converting previous non-customers into active customers
and creating anew market.
+ Asimprovements aremade innew-market disruptions, the
companies that foster them areable topull customers out
ofold.Stream value networks and into new ones.Two types of disruption: low-end 
disruption and new market disruption

What products do customers want to 
buy? (Circumstances)
+ Christensen point out the fact that marketers often
segment markets byproduct price, ordemographics ofthe
individuals orcompanies that comprise their customer
base.
+ This segmentation isoften defined bythe attributes of
products orcustomers
+ Point outwhat isthecorrelations between attributes and outcomes.
+ What features, functions and positioning will cause customers to
buy aproduct.

+ To solve this problem, Christensen introduced the
'circumstances’ concept and offered amore reasonable way
ofsegmenting themarket
+ The customers ‘hire' products todospecific 'jobs',
+ Managers must segment their markets tomirror the way oftheir
customers experience life.
+ Successful products must target the circumstances of
customers find themselves, rather than the customers
themselves.What products do customers want to 
buy? (Circumstances)

+ Highlighted the importance of understanding the
circumstances which acustomer buys aproduct.
+ Knowing what jobofeach product gets hired todo,
+ Knowing what jobs out there are not getting done very well by
particular products
+ Can give innovators amuch clearer road map forimproving their
products tobeat the true competition from the customer's
perspective.
+ This segmentation canbeused togain adisruptive foothold

buy? (Circumstances)

+ While itmay never bepossible togetevery dimension ofa
product introduction inanew-market disruption right
straight away,
+ Using the jobs-to-be-done lens can help innovators come
tomarket with aninitial product that ismuch closer to
what customers ultimately value.What products do customers want to 
buy? (Circumstances)

The Best Customers for Your Products
low-end and new-market customers
+ The low-end disruptor's marketing task isextending the
low-cost business model uptowards products that more
profitable forcustomers tobedone.
+ Itiseasy toidentify ideal customers for alow-end
disruption, and they are uninterested people tohigh-
performance products.
+ New-market disruptions require the innovators toinvent
the upward path, because no one has been up that
trajectory before.

The Best Customers for Your Products
low-end and new-market customers
+ Identifying new-market customers isacomplex task,
because there are different reasons fornon-consumption
that thenew entrant tries toattract.
+ When only afraction ofapopulation isusing aproduct,
some ofthenotreflect thereally using it
+ There isnojob that needs tobedone innon-consumers
lives.
+ Thus,aproduct that aims tohelp non-consumers do
something that they had not already prioritized intheir
lives isunlikely tosucceed.

The Best Customers for Your Products
low-end and new-market customers
+ Another kind ofnon-consumption occurs when people try
togetajobdone butfind themselves unable toaccomplish
it,because theavailable products aretoo expensive ortoo
complicated forthem.
+ Hence, they putupwith getting itdone inaninconvenient,
expensive, unsatisfying way, orsimply donotdoitatall.
+ This type ofnon-consumption isagrowth opportunity
awaiting anew-market disruption that enables these
consumers tobegin buying and using aproduct that helps
them dothejob.

Organizational responses to disruptive 
innovations: 
Core Competence vs. Outsourcing
+ Decisions about what activities tohandle in-house and
what toattain from suppliers orpartners have ahuge
impact onchances ofsuccess.
+ Most companies follow the core competency rule, soIf
something fitsacompany's core competence.thecompany
should doitin-house (vice versa ).–itisdiscussed in
chapter.
+ The problem with this approach isthat“what seems tobea
secondary activity today might become an absolutely
crucial competence tohave inthefuture”

+ Instead ofasking what their company does best today,
managers should determine what they need tomaster
today and inthefuture inorder toexcel onthetrajectory
ofimprovement that customers will define asimportant.
+ From the job-to-be-done perspective, customers will not
buy your product unless itsolves aproblem forthem.
+ What comprises asolution, differ across two circumstances
ofcurrent solution:
+ The products arenotgood enough (Poor Quality).
+ Ormore than good enough (More Expensive). Organizational responses to disruptive 
innovations: 
Core Competence vs. Outsourcing

+ The advantage goes tointegration when products are not
good enough
+ And tooutsourcing when theproducts aremore than good
enough.
+ So, the decision should bebased onthe nature ofthe
innovation inquestion:
+ Systemic innovation,vertical integration issuperior tovirtual
organization:
+ Innovation isautonomous and can bepursued independently, virtual
organization issuperior tovertical integration Organizational responses to disruptive 
innovations: 
Core Competence vs. Outsourcing

+ When product functionality and reliability arenot yetgood
enough toaddress theneeds ofcustomers inagiven tier of
themarket,
+ companies must compete bymaking the best possible
products.
+ Firms that build complex products interdependent
architectures such asone part cannot becreated orused
independently ofanother part.
+ Companies that compete with proprietary, interdependent
architectures must beintegrated and they must control the
design and manufacture ofevery critical component ofthe
system Organizational responses to disruptive 
innovations: 
Core Competence vs. Outsourcing

+ Once customers' requirements for functionality and
reliability have been met, itshould redefine what isnot
good enough, which changes the basis ofcompetition in
that market
+ The pressure ofcompeting along this new trajectory of
improvement force agradual evolution in product
architecture, away from the proprietary and
interdependent, towards more modular designs inaperiod
of'too good' performance Organizational responses to disruptive 
innovations: 
Core Competence vs. Outsourcing

+ Modular architectures enable companies tointroduce new
products faster because they can upgrade individual pieces ofa
product without having tocreate abrand-new design.
+ Modularity enables independent, non-integrated organizations
tosell, buy and assemble components and subsystems.
+ This scenario clearly favors outsourcing and virtual
organizational designs.
+ Soinparallel with thenature ofinnovation, another important
dimension to consider when choosing appropriate
organizational designs isthe stage ofdevelopment from the
customers' job-to-be-done perspective. Organizational responses to disruptive 
innovations: 
Core Competence vs. Outsourcing

Organizational structures and 
disruptive innovations
+ Organizations have different cost structures, and this
structure often determines ifan innovation isworth
pursuing.
+ Ifthe structure ofacompany's overhead costs requires it
toachieve gross profit margins of%,most ideas that
promise gross margins below %arelikely tobekilled off.
These organization would beunable tosuccess inlow-
margin businesses.
+ Incontrast.adifferent organization with adifferent cost
structure might accord ahigh priority toasimilar project.

Organizational structures and 
disruptive innovations
+ Ifanew product has the potential togenerate $million
revenue,
+ itmight notbeattractive toMicrosoft atall,
+ but itwould beextremely attractive tomany other companies with
lower cost structures and smaller sizes.
+ These differences create the asymmetries ofmotivation
that exist between disruptors and those that aredisrupted.

Organizational structures and 
disruptive innovations
+ Leaders inanindustry almost always emerge victorious in
sustaining technology battles,
+ Whereas historically they have almost always lost battles of
disruption.
+ Industry leaders
+ Develop and introduce sustaining technologies over and over again,
+ This enables them todevelop acapability forsustaining innovation
that resides intheir processes.
+ Sustaining technology investments also fitthe values ofthe
leading companies, because they promise improved profit
margins from better orcost-reduced products.

Organizational structures and 
disruptive innovations
+ Incontrast, nocompany has anestablished process for
handling disruptive innovations.
+ Disruptive products typically
+ Promise lower profit margins and
+ Cannot beused bythebest customers,
+ Making disruptions inconsistent with many companies'
values.
+ Leading companies have the resources required tosucceed,
but their processes and values are not designed topursue
disruptive innovation.

+ Smaller, disruptive companies aredifferent:
+ They might lack resources,
+ Buttheir values canembrace small markets and
+ Their cost structures canaccommodate lower margins.
+ These advantages can add uptoenormous opportunity
for them tobeat industry leaders through disruptive
strategic innovations.Organizational structures and 
disruptive innovations

Top-Down Disruptions
+ Most authors ofstrategic disruption have focused on
bottom-upornew-market disruptions
+ Adisruptive product orservice usually underperforms
established products orservices inthecurrent markets.
+ The disruptive products and services are usually sold less
money than the current offering,tothe least profitable
customers and gain low margins profitable.
+ Asthe performance ofthe product orservice improves
steadily, the Top-Down disruptions redefine the entire
market and replace thecurrent companies inprocess.

Top-Down Disruptions
+ However.Nicholas Carr highlighted another type of
disruptive innovation top-down disruption.
+ Started atthe top end ofthe market and rapidly moved
downwards todisrupt established markets,
+ Outperform existing products when they areintroduced,
+ Selling atapremium price rather than adiscount.
+ These products and services areinitially purchased bythe
most demanding and least price-sensitive customers,
+ They move steadily downwards todisrupt the entire
market.

Top-Down Disruptions
+ However, the potential danger ofthe top-down strategy
was notemphasize here Inrecent years.
+ Many premium brands moved downwards from the top-
end, premium market niches toLow-cost market.
+ Such amove often increases revenue and profit very rapidly
forafew years,
+ Butthelong-term viability ofthis strategy isless certain.
+ Itmay damage-orcheapen-the brand and disfranchise
their most profitable customers atthe top end inthe long
term.

Disruptive Strategic Innovations in 
Action in the Network Economy: 
Some Examples
+ Although the strategy ofdisruptive innovations isnot
unique orspecific tothe knowledge-based, network
economy,
+ Insome sectors, thecompanies managed tofight back and
further secured their dominant positions.
+ But inothers cases, they have made asignificant impact,
such aseBay, Amazon.com, Google.
+ New entrants successfully using the Internet todisrupt
established companies either through low-cost disruption
ornew market disruptions.

+ Many established companies reacted quickly, byusing the
Internet tosustain their core business, orbysetting upa
separate unit tocompete with thenew entrants.
+ Some companies went further tonominate new entrants while
sustaining their existing business models and services.
+ AstheInternet continues togrow more versatile anrapidly,it
ispossible todevelop new business models that areradically
different from theexisting ones and develop new products and
services that could turn non-consumers into profitable
customers. Disruptive Strategic Innovations in 
Action in the Network Economy: 
Some Examples

The Strategy of Disruption: Threats, 
Opportunities and Possible Responses
+ Disruptive technologies and business models have
overbalanced many established industry leaders.
+ The potential threats from low-end or new-market
disruptive innovations arewell understood today.
+ However, research has also shown that disruption always
creates new markets and new net growth, which provide
new opportunities foroldand new companies alike
+ Inparticular, forthe established companies under attack
from low-end ornew market entrants, byseeking new
customers different from current established businesses.

The Strategy of Disruption: Threats, 
Opportunities and Possible Responses
+ According toGilbert, Disruption isnot one phenomenon,
and itdevelops over three distinct phases.
.Itistheinitial phase, theinnovation creates anew market
independent ofthe established business ofcompanies
(big player).
.New market isexpand which lead thegradually slows the
growth oftheestablished businesses.
.Then, the third phase, having improved significantly over
time, itradically reduces thesize oftheoldmarket.
+ This applies toboth the low-end disruptions and new-
market disruption

The Strategy of Disruption: Threats, 
Opportunities and Possible Responses
+ Gilbert argued that adisruption may not completely
destroy the established business itusually takes away all
thegrowth.
+ This isgood news forestablished organizations asthere is
time for them toidentify new markets before their
established oldmarkets stop and eventually decline.
+ However, inorder todosothey often need toadopt new
business models different from those used for the
established market

The Strategy of Disruption: Threats, 
Opportunities and Possible Responses
+ Charitou and Markides point out the disruptive strategic
innovations arenotnecessarily superior totraditional ways
ofcompeting,and they arenot always intended todestroy
thecurrent market.
+ Based ontheexperience ofawide range ofindustries that
have been under threat from disruptive strategic
innovations inrecent years,
+ There arefive possible responses and explored ‘when todo
what' fortheestablished industry leaders.

The Strategy of Disruption: Threats, 
Opportunities and Possible Responses
+ The challenges from disruptive innovations forestablished
industry leaders arereal and significant,
+ The dilemma isthat
+ The established incumbents could not compete with the
new entrants with their existing strategies and business
models
+ And ifthey adopt the strategies ofthe new competitors
they might risk ordamage their existing business and
strategies which have brought them success inthepast.

The Strategy of Disruption: Threats, 
Opportunities and Possible Responses
.The new entrants usually
+ Emphasize different product or service attributes from the
established industry leaders,
+ Allofthem started out assmall, low-margin businesses, targeting
customers who areunattractive toestablished players.
+ Over time, these new entrants
+ Can compete with established companies by delivering good
performance compere with the old attributes ofestablished
companies butmore superior innew attributes.
+ This usually enables them tocapture alarge share ofthe
established market very quickly.

The Strategy of Disruption: Threats, 
Opportunities and Possible Responses
.Focus onand invest inthetraditional business
+ New entrants willusually capture only-percent ofthemarket.
+ The established companies donot necessarily have tocontains the
new innovation.
+ Ignore theinnovation because itisnotyour business
+ Embracing strategic innovations often requires different value
propositions, skills and competences, targeting new customers, and
often means diversifying inanunrelated market, which ifnot
managed properly canlead todisaster.

The Strategy of Disruption: Threats, 
Opportunities and Possible Responses
.Fight back bydisrupting thedisruption
+ New entrants often compete with established players bybeing good
enough inoldattributes ofproducts and services but emphasizing
certain new attributes.
+ Rather than playing the new game, established players can often
emphasize and compete with even newer attributes todisrupt the
disruptions.

The Strategy of Disruption: Threats, 
Opportunities and Possible Responses
.Adopt the innovation byplaying both games atthe same
time
+ This isusually done bycreating aseparate business unit, with high
levels ofautonomy,
+ Often using adifferent name from theparent company, with itsown
new CEO.
+ However, many ofthese new units share back-office activities with
theparent company
.Hold new innovation completely and scale itup–
+ This means leave existing ways ofdoing things and embracing the
disruptive strategic innovation asnew business model.

The Strategy of Disruption: Threats, 
Opportunities and Possible Responses
+ Charitou and Markides went on todevelop atwo-
dimensional model tohelp companies determine how to
respond todisruptive strategic innovations:
+ The motivation torespond and the company's ability torespond
effectively.
+ Ifboth arelow, then thebest option fortheestablished company is
tofocus onitscore business.
+ When both arehigh, the established company should consider the
different responses ofdifferent customers.

Summary
+ The theory ofdisruptive strategic innovation isone ofthe
most influential theories since thelate  s.
+ Inindustry after industry, new entrants have managed to
disrupt the core markets ofthe established players and
quickly establish themselves asaforce tobereckoned
+ Some established companies have even been squeezed out
ofthemarket.
+ The rapid development and proliferation ofthe ICT have
provided numerous opportunities for new entrants to
develop low-cost models and compete with industry
leaders inways impossible inthepast

Summary
+ Even when the new entrants donot win the war, the
industries themselves are often seriously disrupted and
many industries have already been changed beyond
recognition within ashort period oftime.
+ Asthe technology and infrastructure, more disruptive
strategic innovations will no doubt bedeveloped and
introduced inmany industries.
+ This provides both opportunities and challenges foroldand
new players alike.
+ Tosurvive inthe network economy, allcompanies must
understand the situation and make proper strategic
responses.
