### Introduction

Disruptive innovations create new markets or reshape existing markets by delivering relatively simple, convenient, low-cost innovations to a set of customers who are ignored by industry leaders.

Since the late 90s, a very influential strategic innovation has been the theory of disruptive strategic innovations.

Clayton Christensen of Harvard Business School started the first developed theory in his bestseller book "[The Innovator's Dilemma](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=46)". He explained how industry leaders that focused on high-end products for their most profitable customers can be 'blindsided' by disruptive innovations from new competitors.

In "[The Innovator's Solution: Creating and Sustaining Successful Growth](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=15473)", he established how companies can create disruptive innovations rather than being destroyed by them.
  
It shows how to turn innovative ideas into new disruptive products that can lead to long-term profitable growth.
  
In another book written by Eric Roth and Scott Anthony, "[Seeing What's Next: Using the Theory of Innovation to Predict Industry Change](https://store.hbr.org/product/seeing-what-s-next-using-the-theories-of-innovation-to-predict-industry-change/1857#:~:text=Based%20on%20proven%20theories%20outlined,and%20assess%20whether%20a%20firm's)," the book describes, summarizes, and further develops the disruptive theory of strategic innovations and supports it with new evidence and more detailed explanations.

The strategy of disruption is one of the most influential theories in recent years.
  
It provides a powerful framework for executives to identify emerging opportunities and challenges in the market and develop appropriate strategic responses.
  
It provides an insightful explanation to a question that has been puzzling academics, consultants, and business executives for decades: Why do successful companies fail to sustain profitable growth for more than a few years?

According to this theory, companies fail not because the executives and workers are doing a bad job, but because they have been doing an excellent job in what they are supposed to be doing: improving products rapidly and continuously and focusing on the needs of the high-end, most profitable customers.

The theory of disruptive innovation is not specific to the knowledge-based, network economy. Many disruptive innovations were introduced in different sectors.
  
Disruptive strategic innovations are particularly influential—and disruptive—in today's business environment, because of the extremely rapid development and widespread proliferation of ICTs.
  
Examples include eBay, Google, Amazon.com, Expedia, Travelocity, and so on. These new entrants have radically disrupted a wide range of industries such as auctions, book retailing, holidays, travel, and hotel booking.

### The Strategy of Disruption - From "The Innovator's Dilemma" to "The Innovator's Solution"

Christensen pointed out that roughly only one company in every ten is able to sustain the kind of growth needed.

Once a company's core business has matured, it should look for new platforms for growth which include significant risk.

Most companies simply do not know how to grow. Following growth in the wrong way can be worse than no growth at all.

Managers have long sought ways to predict the outcome of competition based around innovation, but it has become difficult to do so in recent years.

It is no longer simply a matter of large companies using their resources to crush smaller competitors by bringing incremental changes and attention to innovation that enable them to outperform the competition.

It is the 'circumstances' of innovations that often determine whether current industry leaders or upstart companies win a competitive war.

New entrants are more likely to overtake old leaders in disruptive circumstances when the challenge is to commercialize a simpler, more convenient product that sells for less money and attracts new customers.

Established large companies can capture disruptive growth, rather than be defeated by it, if they are aware of the circumstances of disruptive innovations and are able to use them for their own benefit.

### Two Types of Innovation: Sustaining vs. Disruptive Innovation

Different from the classification of innovations into autonomous and systemic innovations when examining the suitability of different organizational models and designs in the last chapter, Christensen classified innovations into two categories along a different dimension: **sustaining innovations** and **disruptive innovations**.

The nature of the innovation determines whether established companies or new entrants eventually win the competitive war in the market.

In every industry, there is a rate of improvement in products that customers can fully utilize or use.

However, in most industries, the pace of technological progress almost always outstrips the ability of customers in any given tier of the market to use it.

Partly because companies keep trying to make better products that they can sell for higher profit margins to their most demanding, high-end customers.

This creates a serious problem for established companies making such products.

This creates opportunities for new entrants to enter the market with products with fewer features and lower specifications, first selling them to customers at the lowest market tier, who are the least attractive customers to established companies, but moving upwards to include the high-end customers, who are more profitable customers for the established companies.

A sustaining innovation is targeted at those demanding, high-end customers, with better performance than previously available, whether performance is an incremental improvement or a breakthrough improvement.

Established companies are motivated to focus on following up innovations to meet the needs of their high-end, most profitable customers. This leaves the door open for new entrants to target the low-end customers.

Disruptive innovations do not bring better products and services to established customers in existing markets 

They introduce products and services that are not as good as existing products, but which are simpler, more convenient, and less expensive than existing ones.

As these simpler products continue to improve, new entrants soon get a foothold in the market and gradually squeeze out the established incumbent suppliers.

The history of the computing industry in the past few decades provides an example of this scenario, where disruption often breaks down industry-leading companies.

### Two Types of Disruption: Low-End Disruption and New Market Disruption

To identify where disruptions can take place, an important concept used by Christensen is the value network.

Christensen defined the value network as a plane of competition and consumption in which the application and customers reside.

In other words, a value network is 'the context within which a firm establishes a cost structure and operating processes and works with suppliers and channel partners in order to respond profitably to the common needs of a class of customers.’

Christensen added a third dimension to the disruptive innovation model in "The Innovator's Solution" by extending into new contexts of consumption and competition.

The new value networks constitute new customers who previously lacked the money or skills to buy and use the product, or different situations in which a product can be used.

These were made possible by improvements in simplicity, portability, and costs.

New-market disruptions take place in different value networks by competing with non-consumption, converting previous non-customers into active customers and creating a new market.

As improvements are made in new-market disruptions, the companies that foster them are able to pull customers out of old value networks and into new ones.

### What Products Do Customers Want to Buy? (Circumstances)

Christensen points out the fact that marketers often segment markets by product price or demographics of the individuals or companies that comprise their customer base.

This segmentation is often defined by the attributes of products or customers.

He points out what the correlations between attributes and outcomes are, and what features, functions, and positioning will cause customers to buy a product.

To solve this problem, Christensen introduced the 'circumstances' concept and offered a more reasonable way of segmenting the market.

Customers ‘hire' products to do specific 'jobs', and managers must segment their markets to mirror the way their customers experience life.

Successful products must target the circumstances customers find themselves in, rather than the customers themselves.

Highlighting the importance of understanding the circumstances in which a customer buys a product.

Knowing what job each product gets hired to do, and knowing what jobs out there are not getting done very well by particular products.

This can give innovators a much clearer roadmap for improving their products to beat the true competition from the customer's perspective.

This segmentation can be used to gain a disruptive foothold, the initial product or service being the point of entry for a new market disruption.

While it may never be possible to get every dimension of a product introduction in a new-market disruption right straight away, using the jobs-to-be-done lens can help innovators come to market with an initial product that is much closer to what customers ultimately value.

### The Best Customers for Your Products: Low-End and New-Market Customers

The low-end disruptor's marketing task is extending the low-cost business model upwards towards products that are more profitable for customers.

It is easy to identify ideal customers for a low-end disruption, as they are uninterested in high-performance products.

New-market disruptions require the innovators to invent the upward path because no one has been up that trajectory before.

Identifying new-market customers is a complex task, because there are different reasons for non-consumption that the new entrant tries to attract.

When only a small portion of a population is using a product, it does not necessarily mean that the rest have no need or desire for it. There may be various barriers preventing non-consumers from accessing or using the product, even though they could potentially benefit from it.

There is no job that needs to be done in non-consumers' lives.

Thus, a product that aims to help non-consumers do something that they had not already prioritized in their lives is unlikely to succeed.

Another kind of non-consumption occurs when people try to get a job done but find themselves unable to accomplish it because the available products are too expensive or too complicated for them.

Hence, they put up with getting it done in an inconvenient, expensive, unsatisfying way, or simply do not do it at all.

This type of non-consumption is a growth opportunity awaiting a new-market disruption that enables these consumers to begin buying and using a product that helps them do the job.

### Organizational Responses to Disruptive Innovations: Core Competence vs. Outsourcing

Decisions about what activities to handle in-house and what to attain from suppliers or partners have a huge impact on chances of success.

Most companies follow the core competency rule, so if something fits a company's core competence, the company should do it in-house (and vice versa). This is discussed in chapter 8.

The problem with this approach is that “what seems to be a secondary activity today might become an absolutely crucial competence to have in the future.”

Instead of asking what their company does best today, managers should determine what they need to master today and in the future in order to excel on the trajectory of improvement that customers will define as important.

From the job-to-be-done perspective, customers will not buy your product unless it solves a problem for them.

What comprises a solution differs across two circumstances of the current solution:
1. Poor Quality - the products are not good enough.
2. More Expensive - the products are more than good enough.

The advantage goes to integration when products are not good enough and to outsourcing when the products are more than good enough.

So, the decision should be based on the nature of the innovation in question:
  
Systemic innovation: vertical integration is superior to virtual organization.
  
Autonomous innovation: virtual organization is superior to vertical integration.

When product functionality and reliability are not yet good enough to address the needs of customers in a given tier of the market, companies must compete by making the best possible products.

Firms that build complex products with interdependent architectures, where one part cannot be created or used independently of another part, must be integrated and control the design and manufacture of every critical component of the system.

Once customers' requirements for functionality and reliability have been met, it should redefine what is not good enough, which changes the basis of competition in that market.

The pressure of competing along this new trajectory of improvement forces a gradual evolution in product architecture, away from the proprietary and interdependent, towards more modular designs in a period of 'too good' performance.

Modular architectures enable companies to introduce new products faster because they can upgrade individual pieces of a product without having to create a brand-new design.

Modularity enables independent, non-integrated organizations to sell, buy, and assemble components and subsystems.

This scenario clearly favors outsourcing and virtual organizational designs.

In parallel with the nature of innovation, another important dimension to consider when choosing appropriate organizational designs is the stage of development from the customers' job-to-be-done perspective.

### Organizational Structures and Disruptive Innovations

Organizations have different cost structures, and this structure often determines if an innovation is worth pursuing.

If the structure of a company's overhead costs requires it to achieve gross profit margins of 40%, most ideas that promise gross margins below 40% are likely to be killed off. These organizations would be unable to succeed in low-margin businesses.

In contrast, a different organization with a different cost structure might accord a high priority to a similar project.

If a new product has the potential to generate $10 million revenue, it might not be attractive to Microsoft at all, but it would be extremely attractive to many other companies with lower cost structures and smaller sizes.

These differences create the asymmetries of motivation that exist between disruptors and those that are disrupted.

Leaders in an industry almost always emerge victorious in sustaining technology battles, whereas historically they have almost always lost battles of disruption.
  
Industry leaders develop and introduce sustaining technologies over and over again, enabling them to develop a capability for sustaining innovation that resides in their processes.
  
Sustaining technology investments also fit the values of the leading companies because they promise improved profit margins from better or cost-reduced products.

In contrast, no company has an established process for handling disruptive innovations.
  
Disruptive products typically promise lower profit margins and cannot be used by the best customers, making disruptions inconsistent with many companies' values.
  
Leading companies have the resources required to succeed, but their processes and values are not designed to pursue disruptive innovation.

Smaller, disruptive companies are different:
  
They might lack resources, but their values can embrace small markets and their cost structures can accommodate lower margins.
  
These advantages can add up to enormous opportunities for them to beat industry leaders through disruptive strategic innovations.

### Top-Down Disruptions

Most authors of strategic disruption have focused on bottom-up or new-market disruptions.
  
A disruptive product or service usually underperforms established products or services in the current markets.
  
The disruptive products and services are usually sold for less money than the current offering, to the least profitable customers, and gain low margins.
  
As the performance of the product or service improves steadily, the top-down disruptions redefine the entire market and replace the current companies in the process.

However, Nicholas Carr highlighted another type of disruptive innovation: top-down disruption.
  
This starts at the top end of the market and rapidly moves downwards to disrupt established markets.
  
These products and services outperform existing products when they are introduced, selling at a premium price rather than a discount.
  
They are initially purchased by the most demanding and least price-sensitive customers, then move steadily downwards to disrupt the entire market.

The potential danger of the top-down strategy was not emphasized here in recent years.
  
Many premium brands moved downwards from the top-end, premium market niches to low-cost markets.
  
Such a move often increases revenue and profit very rapidly for a few years, but the long-term viability of this strategy is less certain.
  
It may damage or cheapen the brand and disenfranchise their most profitable customers at the top end in the long term.

### Disruptive Strategic Innovations in Action in the Network Economy: Some Examples

Although the strategy of disruptive innovations is not unique or specific to the knowledge-based, network economy, in some sectors, the companies managed to fight back and further secured their dominant positions.

In other cases, they have made a significant impact, such as eBay, Amazon.com, and Google.
  
New entrants successfully using the Internet to disrupt established companies either through low-cost disruption or new market disruptions.

Many established companies reacted quickly by using the Internet to sustain their core business, or by setting up a separate unit to compete with the new entrants.
  
Some companies went further to nominate new entrants while sustaining their existing business models and services.
  
As the Internet continues to grow more versatile rapidly, it is possible to develop new business models that are radically different from the existing ones and develop new products and services that could turn non-consumers into profitable customers.

### The Strategy of Disruption: Threats, Opportunities, and Possible Responses

Disruptive technologies and business models have overbalanced many established industry leaders.

The potential threats from low-end or new-market disruptive innovations are well understood today.

However, research has also shown that disruption always creates new markets and new net growth, which provide new opportunities for old and new companies alike.
  
In particular, for the established companies under attack from low-end or new market entrants, by seeking new customers different from current established businesses.

According to Gilbert, disruption is not one phenomenon and develops over three distinct phases:
  
In the initial phase, the innovation creates a new market independent of the established business of companies (big players).
  
As the new market expands, it gradually slows the growth of the established businesses.
  
In the third phase, having improved significantly over time, it radically reduces the size of the old market.

This applies to both low-end disruptions and new-market disruptions.

Gilbert argued that a disruption may not completely destroy the established business; it usually takes away all the growth.
  
This is good news for established organizations as there is time for them to identify new markets before their established old markets stop and eventually decline.
  
However, in order to do so, they often need to adopt new business models different from those used for the established market.

Charitou and Markides point out that disruptive strategic innovations are not necessarily superior to traditional ways of competing, and they are not always intended to destroy the current market.
  
Based on the experience of a wide range of industries that have been under threat from disruptive strategic innovations in recent years, there are five possible responses and explored ‘when to do what' for the established industry leaders.

The challenges from disruptive innovations for established industry leaders are real and significant. The dilemma is that:
  
The established incumbents could not compete with the new entrants with their existing strategies and business models.
  
If they adopt the strategies of the new competitors, they might risk or damage their existing business and strategies which have brought them success in the past.

The new entrants usually emphasize different product or service attributes from the established industry leaders.
  
All of them started out as small, low-margin businesses, targeting customers who are unattractive to established players.
  
Over time, these new entrants can compete with established companies by delivering good performance compared to the old attributes of established companies but are more superior in new attributes.
  
This usually enables them to capture a large share of the established market very quickly.

Focus on and invest in the traditional business:
  
New entrants will usually capture only a small percent of the market.
  
The established companies do not necessarily have to contain the new innovation.
  
Ignore the innovation because it is not your business.
  
Embracing strategic innovations often requires different value propositions, skills, and competences, targeting new customers, and often means diversifying in an unrelated market, which if not managed properly can lead to disaster.

Fight back by disrupting the disruption:
  
New entrants often compete with established players by being good enough in old attributes of products and services but emphasizing certain new attributes.
  
Rather than playing the new game, established players can often emphasize and compete with even newer attributes to disrupt the disruptions.

Adopt the innovation by playing both games at the same time:
  
This is usually done by creating a separate business unit, with high levels of autonomy, often using a different name from the parent company, with its own new CEO.
  
However, many of these new units share back-office activities with the parent company.
  
Hold the new innovation completely and scale it up: This means leaving existing ways of doing things and embracing the disruptive strategic innovation as a new business model.

Charitou and Markides went on to develop a two-dimensional model to help companies determine how to respond to disruptive strategic innovations:
  
The motivation to respond and the company's ability to respond effectively.
  
If both are low, then the best option for the established company is to focus on its core business.
  
When both are high, the established company should consider the different responses of different customers.

### Summary

The theory of disruptive strategic innovation is one of the most influential theories since the late 1990s.

In industry after industry, new entrants have managed to disrupt the core markets of the established players and quickly establish themselves as a force to be reckoned with.

Some established companies have even been squeezed out of the market.

The rapid development and proliferation of ICT have provided numerous opportunities for new entrants to develop low-cost models and compete with industry leaders in ways impossible in the past.

Even when the new entrants do not win the war, the industries themselves are often seriously disrupted and many industries have already been changed beyond recognition within a short period of time.

As technology and infrastructure advance, more disruptive strategic innovations will no doubt be developed and introduced in many industries.

This provides both opportunities and challenges for old and new players alike.

To survive in the network economy, all companies must understand the situation and make proper strategic responses.
