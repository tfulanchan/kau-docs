Managing Disruptive Strategic Innovation in the New Economy

Introduction 
+ Disruptive innovations create new markets or reshape existing markets by
+ delivering relative simple, convenient, low cost innovations to a set of customers who areignored byindustry leaders.
+ Since the late  s, a very influential strategic innovation has been thetheory ofdisruptive strategic innovations.
+ Clayton Christensen ofHarvared Business School in started thefirst developed theory inhisbestseller book The Innovator's Dilemma.'He explained how industry leaders that focused onhigh-end products fortheir most profitable
customers can be'blindsided' bydisruptive innovations from new competitors

Introduction 
+ In. The Innovator's Solution creating and sustaining successful growth,
+ This established companies how tocreate disruptive innovations rather than being destroyed bythem,
+ How toturn innovative ideas into new disruptive products that can lead tolong-term profitable growth.
+ In.another book written with Eric Roth and Scott Anthony:Seeing What Next:Using theory ofinnovation to
predict industry change,
+ The book describe, summarize, and further developed thedisruptive theory ofstrategic innovations and supported itwith new evidence and more detailed explanations.

Introduction
+ The strategy of disruption is
+ One of the most influential theories inrecent years
+ It provides apowerful framework for executives toidentify emerging opportunities and challenges inthemarket
+ Develop appropriate strategic responses.
+ It provides aninsightful explanation toaquestion that has been puzzling academics, consultants and business executives for decades:
+ Why do successful companies failtosustain profitable growth for more than a few years ?

Introduction
+ According to this theory, thecompanies fail not because the executives and workers aredoing abad job.

But because
+ They have been doing an excellent job in what they are supposed to be doing
+ Improving products rapidly and continuously
+ Focusing onneeds ofthehigh-end, most profitable customers.

Introduction
+ Theory ofdisruptive innovation isnot specific to the knowledge based, network economy.Many disruptive innovations were introduced indifferent sectors
+ Disruptive strategic innovations are particularly influential-and disruptive intoday's business environment, because of the extremely rapid development and widespread proliferation of ICTs
+ Examples such eBay, Google, Amazon.com, Expedia. Travelocity and soon.These new entrants have radically
disrupted awide range ofindustries such asauctions, book retailing toholidays, traveling, and hotel booking.

### The Strategy of Disruption-From Inventor's Dilemma to Inventor's Solutions

+ Cristensen pointed out that roughly only one company in every tenisable tosustain thekind ofgrowth
+ Once acompany's core business has matured, it should looking fornew platforms forgrowth which have:
+ Include significant risk
+ Most companies simply donotknow how togrow.
+ Following growth with wrong way can make worse than nogrowth at all.

+ Managers have long sought ways topredict theoutcome of competition based around innovation,
+ But it has become difficult todosoinrecent years.
+ It is no longer simply matter oflarge companies, using their resources tocrush smaller competitors
+ To bring incremental changes, and attention toinnovation that enable them to out perform the competition.
+ It is the'circumstances' of innovations that often Determine whether currant industry leaders orupstart companies win acompetitive war. 

+ New-entrants are more likely toovertake old leaders in disruptive circumstances,
+ When the challenge istocommercialize asimpler, more convenient product that sells forless money and attract to new customers.
+ Established current large companies can capture disruptive growth, rather than bedefeated it,ifthey aware of the circumstances ofdisruptive innovations and areable to use it for them and their own benefit.

### Two types of innovation: sustaining versus disruptive innovation
+ Different from the classification of innovations into autonomous and systemic innovations when examining the suitability ofdifferent organizational models and designs in the last chapter.
+ Christensen classified innovations into two categories along a different dimension:sustaining innovations and
disruptive innovations
+ The nature of the innovation determines whether established companies ornew entrants eventually win the competitive war in the market.

+ In every industry, there is a rate of improvement in products that customers can fully utilize oruse.
+ However, inmost industries, the pace of technological progress almost always outstrips the ability of customers in any given tier of the market touseit.
+ Partly because companies keep trying to make better products that they can sell for higher profit margins to their most demanding, high-end customers.
+ This creates aserious problem forestablished companies making such product
+ This creates opportunities fornew entrants toenter the market
+ With products with fewer features and lower specifications,
+ First selling them tocustomers atthelowest market, who the least attractive customers to established companies,
+ But moving upwards toinclude the high end customers, who are more profitable customers for the established companies

A sustaining innovation is:
+ Targets those demanding, high-end customers, with better performance than previously available.Whether performance isan incremental improvement orabreakthrough improvement.
+ Established companies aremotivated tofocus onfollowing upinnovations tomeet the needs oftheir high-end, most profitable customers.
+ This leaves the door open fornew entrants totarget the low-end customers.

+ Disruptive innovations
+ Donot bring better products and services toestablished customers in existing markets.
+ Introduce products and services that are not as good as existing products, But which are simpler, more convenient, and less expensive than existing ones.
+ Asthese simpler products continue toimprove, New entrants soon getafoothold inthe market, and Gradually squeeze outtheestablished incumbent suppliers.
+ The history ofthe computing industry inthe past few decades provides anexample ofthis scenario.

Which is Disruption often breakdown industry-leading companies.

+ To identify where disruptions can take place, an important concept used byChristensen Isthevalue network.
+ Christensen defined the value network asaplane of competition and consumption inwhich theapplication and
customers reside.
+ Inother words, avalue network is'the context within which afirm establishes acost structure and operating
processes and works with suppliers and channel partners in order to respond profitably to the common needs of a class of customers’

+ Christensen added athird dimension tothe disruptive innovation model inThe Innovator's Solutions byextending
into new contexts ofconsumption and competition.
+ The new value networks constitute ofnew customers who previously lacked the money orskills tobuy and use the
product, ordifferent situations inwhich aproduct can be used.
+ These were made possible byimprovements insimplicity, portability and costs.

+ New-market disruptions take place indifferent value networks, by competing with non-consumption By converting previous non-customers into active customers and creating anew market.
+ As improvements are made in new-market disruptions, the companies that foster them are able to pull customers out of old. Stream value networks and into new ones.

What products do customers want to buy? (Circumstances)
+ Christensen point out the fact that marketers often segment markets byproduct price, ordemographics of the individuals orcompanies that comprise their customer base.
+ This segmentation isoften defined bythe attributes of products orcustomers
+ Point outwhat isthecorrelations between attributes and outcomes.
+ What features, functions and positioning will cause customers to buy aproduct.

+ To solve this problem, Christensen introduced the 'circumstances’ concept and offered amore reasonable way of segmenting the market
+ The customers ‘hire' products todospecific 'jobs',
+ Managers must segment their markets tomirror the way of their customers experience life.
+ Successful products must target the circumstances of customers find themselves, rather than the customers themselves.What products do customers want to buy? (Circumstances)

+ Highlighted the importance of understanding the circumstances which acustomer buys aproduct.
+ Knowing what jobofeach product gets hired to do,
+ Knowing what jobs out there are not getting done very well by particular products
+ Can give innovators amuch clearer road map forimproving their products tobeat the true competition from the customer's perspective.
+ This segmentation can be used to gain a disruptive foot hold theinitial product orservice that isthepoint ofentry for a new market disruption.What products do customers want to buy? (Circumstances)

+ While itmay never bepossible togetevery dimension of a product introduction inanew-market disruption right straight away,
+ Using the jobs-to-be-done lens can help innovators come tomarket with aninitial product that ismuch closer to
what customers ultimately value.What products do customers want to buy? (Circumstances)

### The Best Customers for Your Products low-end and new-market customers
+ The low-end disruptor's marketing task isextending the low-cost business model uptowards products that more profitable forcustomers tobedone.
+ Itiseasy toidentify ideal customers for alow-end disruption, and they are uninterested people tohigh-
performance products.
+ New-market disruptions require the innovators to invent the upward path, because no one has been up that
trajectory before.

+ Identifying new-market customers isacomplex task, because there are different reasons fornon-consumption that thenew entrant tries toattract.
+ When only afraction ofapopulation isusing aproduct, some ofthenotreflect thereally using it
+ There isnojob that needs tobedone innon-consumers lives.
+ Thus,aproduct that aims tohelp non-consumers do something that they had not already prioritized in their lives isunlikely tosucceed.

+ Another kind ofnon-consumption occurs when people try to get a job done butfind themselves unable to accomplish it,because theavailable products aretoo expensive or too complicated forthem.
+ Hence, they putupwith getting itdone in an inconvenient, expensive, unsatisfying way, orsimply do not do it at all.
+ This type ofnon-consumption isagrowth opportunity awaiting anew-market disruption that enables these consumers tobegin buying and using aproduct that helps them do the job.

### Organizational responses to disruptive innovations: Core Competence vs. Outsourcing
+ Decisions about what activities tohandle in-house and what toattain from suppliers orpartners have ahuge
impact onchances ofsuccess.
+ Most companies follow the core competency rule, soIf something fitsacompany's core competence.the company should doitin-house (vice versa ).–itisdiscussed in chapter.
+ The problem with this approach is that“what seems to be a secondary activity today might become an absolutely crucial competence tohave inthefuture”

+ Instead ofasking what their company does best today, managers should determine what they need tomaster today and in the future in order to excel on the trajectory of improvement that customers will define as important.
+ From the job-to-be-done perspective, customers will not
buy your product unless itsolves aproblem forthem.
+ What comprises asolution, differ across two circumstances of current solution:
+ The products arenotgood enough (Poor Quality).
+ Or more than good enough (More Expensive).

+ The advantage goes to integration when products are not good enough
+ And tooutsourcing when theproducts aremore than good enough.
+ So, the decision should bebased onthe nature of the innovation in question:
+ Systemic innovation,vertical integration issuperior tovirtual organization:
+ Innovation isautonomous and can bepursued independently, virtual organization issuperior tovertical integration 

+ When product functionality and reliability are not yet good enough toaddress theneeds ofcustomers inagiven tier of the market,
+ companies must compete bymaking the best possible products.
+ Firms that build complex products interdependent architectures such asone part cannot becreated orused
independently of another part.
+ Companies that compete with proprietary, interdependent architectures must beintegrated and they must control the design and manufacture ofevery critical component of the system 

+ Once customers' requirements for functionality and reliability have been met, itshould redefine what is not good enough, which changes the basis ofcompetition in that market
+ The pressure ofcompeting along this new trajectory of improvement force agradual evolution in product architecture, away from the proprietary and interdependent, towards more modular designs inaperiod of'too good' performance Organizational responses to disruptive  innovations: 

+ Modular architectures enable companies tointroduce new products faster because they can upgrade individual pieces of a product without having tocreate abrand-new design.
+ Modularity enables independent, non-integrated organizations to sell, buy and assemble components and subsystems.
+ This scenario clearly favors outsourcing and virtual organizational designs.
+ So in parallel with the nature of innovation, another important dimension to consider when choosing appropriate organizational designs isthe stage ofdevelopment from the customers' job-to-be-done perspective. 

+ Organizations have different cost structures, and this structure often determines ifan innovation isworth
pursuing.
+ If the structure ofacompany's overhead costs requires it to achieve gross profit margins of%,most ideas that promise gross margins below %arelikely tobekilled off.
These organization would beunable tosuccess in low-margin businesses.
+ In contrast, a different organization with adifferent cost structure might accord ahigh priority toasimilar project.

+ If a new product has the potential togenerate $million revenue,
+ it might notbeattractive toMicrosoft atall,
+ but itwould beextremely attractive tomany other companies with lower cost structures and smaller sizes.
+ These differences create the asymmetries of motivation that exist between disruptors and those that aredisrupted.

+ Leaders inanindustry almost always emerge victorious in sustaining technology battles,
+ Whereas historically they have almost always lost battles of disruption.
+ Industry leaders
+ Develop and introduce sustaining technologies over and over again,
+ This enables them todevelop acapability forsustaining innovation that resides intheir processes.
+ Sustaining technology investments also fitthe values of the leading companies, because they promise improved profit margins from better orcost-reduced products.

+ Incontrast, nocompany has anestablished process for handling disruptive innovations.
+ Disruptive products typically
+ Promise lower profit margins and
+ Cannot beused bythebest customers,
+ Making disruptions inconsistent with many companies' values.
+ Leading companies have the resources required tosucceed, but their processes and values are not designed to pursue disruptive innovation.
+ Smaller, disruptive companies aredifferent:
+ They might lack resources,
+ But their values canembrace small markets and
+ Their cost structures canaccommodate lower margins.
+ These advantages can add uptoenormous opportunity for them tobeat industry leaders through disruptive strategic innovations.Organizational structures and disruptive innovations

### Top-Down Disruptions

+ Most authors ofstrategic disruption have focused on bottom-upornew-market disruptions
+ Adisruptive product orservice usually underperforms established products orservices inthecurrent markets.
+ The disruptive products and services are usually sold less money than the current offering,tothe least profitable customers and gain low margins profitable.
+ Asthe performance ofthe product orservice improves steadily, the  redefine the entire market and replace thecurrent companies inprocess.
+ 
+ However.Nicholas Carr highlighted another type of disruptive innovation top-down disruption.
+ Started atthe top end ofthe market and rapidly moved downwards todisrupt established markets,
+ Outperform existing products when they areintroduced,
+ Selling atapremium price rather than adiscount.
+ These products and services areinitially purchased bythe most demanding and least price-sensitive customers,
+ They move steadily downwards todisrupt the entire market.

+ However, the potential danger ofthe top-down strategy was notemphasize here Inrecent years.
+ Many premium brands moved downwards from the top-end, premium market niches toLow-cost market.
+ Such amove often increases revenue and profit very rapidly for a few years,
+ But the long-term viability ofthis strategy isless certain.
+ It may damage-orcheapen-the brand and disfranchise their most profitable customers atthe top end inthe long term.

### Disruptive Strategic Innovations in Action in the Network Economy: Some Examples

+ Although the strategy ofdisruptive innovations is not unique orspecific tothe knowledge-based, network economy,
+ Insome sectors, thecompanies managed tofight back and further secured their dominant positions.
+ But inothers cases, they have made asignificant impact, such aseBay, Amazon.com, Google.
+ New entrants successfully using the Internet to disrupt established companies either through low-cost disruption or new market disruptions.

+ Many established companies reacted quickly, by using the Internet tosustain their core business, orbysetting up a separate unit tocompete with thenew entrants.
+ Some companies went further tonominate new entrants while sustaining their existing business models and services.
+ As the Internet continues togrow more versatile anrapidly,it is possible todevelop new business models that are radically different from theexisting ones and develop new products and services that could turn non-consumers into profitable customers.

### The Strategy of Disruption: Threats, Opportunities and Possible Responses

+ Disruptive technologies and business models have overbalanced many established industry leaders.
+ The potential threats from low-end or new-market disruptive innovations arewell understood today.
+ However, research has also shown that disruption always creates new markets and new net growth, which provide new opportunities foroldand new companies alike
+ Inparticular, forthe established companies under attack from low-end ornew market entrants, byseeking new customers different from current established businesses.


+ According toGilbert, Disruption isnot one phenomenon, and itdevelops over three distinct phases.
.

It is the initial phase, theinnovation creates anew market independent ofthe established business ofcompanies
(big player)..New market isexpand which lead thegradually slows the
growth oftheestablished businesses.
.Then, the third phase, having improved significantly over time, itradically reduces thesize oftheoldmarket.
+ This applies toboth the low-end disruptions and new-market disruption



+ Gilbert argued that adisruption may not completely destroy the established business itusually takes away all
the growth.
+ This isgood news forestablished organizations asthere is time for them toidentify new markets before their established oldmarkets stop and eventually decline.
+ However, inorder todosothey often need toadopt new business models different from those used for the established market


+ Charitou and Markides point out the disruptive strategic innovations arenotnecessarily superior totraditional ways ofcompeting,and they arenot always intended todestroy thecurrent market.
+ Based ontheexperience ofawide range ofindustries that have been under threat from disruptive strategic innovations inrecent years,
+ There arefive possible responses and explored ‘when todo what' fortheestablished industry leaders.


+ The challenges from disruptive innovations forestablished industry leaders arereal and significant,
+ The dilemma isthat
+ The established incumbents could not compete with the new entrants with their existing strategies and business models
+ And if they adopt the strategies ofthe new competitors they might risk ordamage their existing business and
strategies which have brought them success inthepast.


.The new entrants usually
+ Emphasize different product or service attributes from the established industry leaders,
+ Allofthem started out assmall, low-margin businesses, targeting customers who areunattractive toestablished players.
+ Over time, these new entrants
+ Can compete with established companies by delivering good performance compere with the old attributes of established companies butmore superior innew attributes.
+ This usually enables them tocapture alarge share of the established market very quickly.


.Focus onand invest inthetraditional business
+ New entrants willusually capture only-percent ofthemarket.
+ The established companies donot necessarily have tocontains the new innovation.
+ Ignore theinnovation because itisnotyour business
+ Embracing strategic innovations often requires different value propositions, skills and competences, targeting new customers, and often means diversifying inanunrelated market, which ifnot managed properly canlead todisaster.


.

Fight back bydisrupting thedisruption
+ New entrants often compete with established players by being good enough inoldattributes ofproducts and services but emphasizing
certain new attributes.
+ Rather than playing the new game, established players can often emphasize and compete with even newer attributes todisrupt the disruptions.


.Adopt the innovation byplaying both games atthe same time
+ This isusually done bycreating aseparate business unit, with high levels ofautonomy,
+ Often using adifferent name from theparent company, with its own new CEO.
+ However, many ofthese new units share back-office activities with the parent company
.Hold new innovation completely and scale itup–
+ This means leave existing ways ofdoing things and embracing the
disruptive strategic innovation asnew business model.


+ Charitou and Markides went on todevelop a two-dimensional model tohelp companies determine how to respond to disruptive strategic innovations:
+ The motivation torespond and the company's ability torespond effectively.
+ Ifboth arelow, then thebest option fortheestablished company is to focus onitscore business.
+ When both arehigh, the established company should consider the different responses ofdifferent customers.

Summary
+ The theory of disruptive strategic innovation is one ofthe most influential theories since thelate  s.
+ Inindustry after industry, new entrants have managed to disrupt the core markets ofthe established players and quickly establish themselves asaforce tobereckoned
+ Some established companies have even been squeezed out of the market.
+ The rapid development and proliferation ofthe ICT have provided numerous opportunities for new entrants to develop low-cost models and compete with industry leaders inways impossible inthepast

Summary
+ Even when the new entrants donot win the war, the industries themselves are often seriously disrupted and many industries have already been changed beyond recognition within ashort period oftime.
+ As the technology and infrastructure, more disruptive
strategic innovations will no doubt bedeveloped and introduced inmany industries.
+ This provides both opportunities and challenges foroldand new players alike.
+ To survive inthe network economy, allcompanies must understand the situation and make proper strategic
responses.
