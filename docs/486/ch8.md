Introduction 

The rapid development oftheInternet and related technologies,

Combined with the changing nature ofthe economy and other changes in the business environment,

Has facilitated theemergence ofnew business strategies.

Some of the new strategies have been discussed inthe last three chapters.

One of the main aims ofagood strategy is to lead tocircumstances in the long term that are favorable to profit generation.

However,strategies do not automatically translate into profit. Instead profit is earned through the day-to-day operation ofthecompany.

Structural profit potential, asderived from theability tocreate value for customers and make aunique contribution,isspecified systematically by what is known as the business model.


Introduction 

In other words, toimplement new strategies and to translate them into new structures,processes and day-to-day activities, themissing link that needs tobeexplored is the business model.

Since the mid- s,numerous studies have been undertaken toidentify, describe and conceptualize them.

This chapter will highlight some ofthekeyresearch findings inrecent years.

What Is a Business Model?

Definitions of a business model vary but a common description is about how abusiness works and the logic that creates its value.

Jutla,abusiness model determines processes and transactions.

Timmers defined abusiness model as

The organization,or architecture, of product, service and information flows, and the sources ofrevenue and benefits for suppliers and customers.

Afuah and Tucci defined the business model

As the method bywhich afirm builds and uses itsresources tooffer its customers better value than its competitors and tomake money in doing so.

Inparticular, abusiness model details

How a firm makes money now and inthefuture, and itenables afirm to have sustainable competitive advantages over its competitors.



What Is an E-Business Model?

Like theconcept ofthebusiness model,

e-Business model isalso amultidimensional concept.

Many authors have attempted toconceptualize e-Business models in asystematic fashion.

E-Business models generally describe emerging business models that exploit thenew capabilities oftheInternet and related technologies.

What Is an E-Business Model?

Since the dot.com boom ofthe late  s,many studies have been carried out.

Early studies have mainly focused on identifying and describing various e-Business models and classifying them into different categories.

Based onacomprehensive review ofliterature, Yousept classified studies ofe-Business models into three main categories:



What Is an E-Business Model?

E-Business models building blocks

Outlined themain components and building blocks that make upthe architectural configuration ofe-Business.

E-Business model content and evaluation 
E-Business model content framework focuses on what is and should bethecore ofagood e-Business model (viability, value creation and
capture potential);

E-Business model evaluation provides tools and frameworks to systematically assess theviability of the e-Business model. .E-Business model classification

focuses onthe classifications ofvarious models (Purpose of e-Business).

Current E-Business Models

Timmers made afirst attempt toclassify different ways of doing business on the Internet and provided some preliminary categorizations ofthephenomenon.

Hestarted with asystematic approach of

Identifying architectures forbusiness models,

Then based ontheidea ofvalue chain deconstruction and reconstruction

Identifying possible ways ofintegrating information along the chain between the different components,

Hethen explored two dimensions ofeach ofthebusiness models

The extent ofinnovation ofthebusiness model,

The extent ofintegration ofinformation and functions along the value chain



Current E-Business Models

Timmers defined abusiness model asanarchitecture for product, service, and information flows,including

Adescription ofthevarious business actors and their roles,

Adescription ofthe potential benefits for the various business actors,

And adescription ofthesources ofrevenue.

Based onthis definition heillustrated, eleven e-Business models

That canbeobserved inthereal world.

Widely referred toinother studies ofe-Business models.

Most ofthese models areself-explanatory. 

Current E-Business Models.
E-Shops–Web marketing by an organization or an online shop.
e-Procurement-theelectronic tendering and procurement of goods and services.
e-Malls-acollection ofe-Shops enhanced byacommon umbrella.
e-Auctions-electronic implementation of bidding mechanisms.
Virtual communities-online communities ofmembers with common interests



Current E-Business Models
.Collaboration platforms =the provision of tools and information environment for collaboration between enterprises.
Third-party marketplaces-using athird party to provide web marketing oronline shop.
Value-chain integrators-integrating multiple steps of the value chain, with the potential toexploit the information flows between those steps asfurther added value.
Value-chain service providers-companies specializing in a specific part ofthe value chain (e.g.e-Logistics, e-Payments );
Current E-Business Models.
Information brokerage-new information services such as information search, customer profiling and business opportunity brokerage.
Trust and other services-trust services by certification authorities orothers.Other services include the delivery of business information and consultancy services.

By mapping the business models onto a two-dimensional framework, Timmers identified two opposite trends forthe future evolution ofe-business models:-

One isthemove toward increased integration ofinformation flow

The other isthe development ofspecialized, highly innovative services.


Current E-Business Models

Classification of E-Business Models: Michael Rappa, Allan Afuah and Christopher Tucci

Rappa identified and conceptualized aseries ofe-Business models primarily from

The perspective ofrevenue generation,

The main categories aresummarized inthefollowing table

Utility Pay-as-you-go-approach 

Classification of E-Business Models: Michael Rappa, Allan Afuah and Christopher Tucci



Afuah and Tucci moved beyond the identification of individual categories ofe-Business models todeveloping a
classification.

They have specifically emphasized the importance of revenue generation intheir classification ofe-Business
models.

The keycomponents theauthors identified aspart of the e-Business model include:

The value that afirm offers itscustomers ;

The segment ofcustomers ittargets towhom itwill offer thevalue ;

The scope ofproducts and services itoffers toeach segment of customers. Classification of E-Business Models: 

Michael Rappa, Allan Afuah and Christopher Tucci

The profit site itchooses ;

Itssources ofrevenue ;

The prices itputs onthevalue offered toitscustomers ;

The activities itmust perform inoffering that value ;

The capabilities these activities rest on;

What afirm must dotosustain any advantages ithas;

How well itcanimplement allthese different elements. Classification of E-Business Models: 

Michael Rappa, Allan Afuah and Christopher Tucci



The authors then argued that these components must work in a system,

How well the system works depends on the key components aswell asthe relationships between and amongst them.

Furthermore, therelationship between the business model and its environment is also very important,

Agood business model needs tobecapable of taking advantage ofany new opportunities and containing the
effects ofemerging threats and challenges. 

Classification of E-Business Models: Michael Rappa, Allan Afuah and Christopher Tucci


Afuah and Tucci considered the e-Business model as the method bywhich afirm plans tomake money long term
using the Internet.

It is the system that takes advantage ofthe properties of the Internet tomake money.

They identified seven possible revenue models to in their classification of e-Business models: 

Classification of E-Business Models: Michael Rappa, Allan Afuah and Christopher Tucci



.

Commission-fees levied ontransactions based onthe size of the transaction ;.

Advertising-revenue generated bycharging for advertising rather than bychar ging theend users forusing thewebsite ;.

Mark-up-the primary source ofrevenue from mark-upon the products itsells viatheInternet ;
.

Production-which Rappa called the manufacturing model, where the manufacturer sells tothe customers directly via the Internet ;.

Referral-based-firms rely onfees forsteering visitors to another company's site; Classification of E-Business Models:

Michael Rappa, Allan Afuah and Christopher Tucci.

Subscription-based-thecompany charges users aflatrate onaperiodic basis forcertain services ;.

Fee-for-service based-activities aremetered and the users pay forwhat they consume, which Rappa calls the utility model.

Classification of E-Business Models: Michael Rappa, Allan Afuah and Christopher Tucci



The authors recognized that their classification was based on the dominant revenue model,

The revenue model isonly one ofatleast four dimensions that determine theclassification ofbusiness models.

By analyzing and comparing previous studies ofbusiness models along four dimensions –

Profit site,Revenue model,Commerce strategy and Pricing model,

they are able todescribe the typology ofe-Business models in a systematic fashion. 

Classification of E-Business Models: Michael Rappa, Allan Afuah and Christopher Tucci


Identified eleven profit sites within theInternet infrastructure,which are summarized as

e-Commerce,content aggregators, brokers/agents, market-maker, service providers, backbone operators, ISPs, last mile, content creators, software suppliers and hardware suppliers.

Identify therevenue model, which aresummarized:

Commission, Advertising, Mark-up, Production, Referral-based, Subscription-based, and Fee-for-
service based

Along the dimension ofcommerce strategy,they identified five main categories, namely, B2B(business to business), B2C(business toconsumer), P2P(person to person or peer to peer, also known asconsumer to consumer-C2C), C2B(consumer tobusiness), and B2E(business toemployee).

Interms ofpricing models,

identified five separate categories-fixed pricing, one-to-one bargaining, auctions, reverse auctions and barter.

By overlaying these four dimensions, theauthors believe that most e-Business models canbecharacterized.

An E-Business Model Ontology

Ostelwalder

Osterwalder believed that despite the significant progress made byprevious studies ofe-Business models,

most previous studies dealt with only some aspects ofthe concept while neglecting ordownplaying others.

Hedefined abusiness model asthe logic ofabusiness system for creating value that lies behind the actual processes.

Abusiness model needs toaddress

The revenue and product aspects,

The business actor and network aspects,

The marketing aspects ofabusiness.

Inorder toprovide anappropriate foundation fortools that would allow the effective and consistent understanding, sharing and communicating, changing, measuring and simulating ofthee-Business models,..cont.
