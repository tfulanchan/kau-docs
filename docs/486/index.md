### Web economy

In the web economy, companies often face high risks when selecting standards, as changing course later can be costly. To mitigate this, some firms give away core technologies to boost adoption, creating increasing returns that attract more participants in a positive feedback loop. Webs are not formal associations, but rather independent companies pursuing economic self-interest, enabled by shared standards that allow them to focus on unique value while benefiting from the web's growth. This reduces market entry barriers and investment requirements, allowing firms to concentrate on their most promising areas, ultimately driving continued expansion of the web economy.

An economic web is a network of independent companies using a common architecture to deliver elements of a value proposition, exemplified by the Microsoft and Intel (Wintel) PC web. Within this network, companies operate autonomously, driven by economic self-interest. 

A technology web consists of independent companies organized around a technological platform, enabling industries to unbundle and allow specialized players, such as in online services.

Within this, a value web focuses on maximizing value for companies using a common technology platform, like Apple's Macintosh vs. Microsoft/Intel PCs.

Emerging types of webs include the customer web, which manages deep customer relationships to satisfy a wide range of needs, and the market web, which focuses on specific transactions, such as mortgage portals.

For an economic web to form, there must be a technological standard and increasing returns to encourage investment and reduce risk.

| Type of Web      | Description | Example |
|------------------|-------------|---------|
| Economic Web     | A cluster of independent companies using a common architecture to deliver elements of a value proposition to consumers.     | Microsoft and Intel (Wintel) PC web   |
| Technology Web   | A cluster of independent companies organized around a technological platform, enabling unbundling of vertically integrated business models. | Online services                       |
| Value Web        | Operates within the technology web to maximize value for companies adopting a common technology platform. | Apple's Macintosh vs. Microsoft/Intel PC |
| Customer Web     | Focuses on managing ownership of customer relationships and segments, serving wide-ranging needs by delivering suitable products and services. | -                                     |
| Market Web       | Focuses on a specific type of transaction by developing deep relationships for a particular need with all customers.        | Mortgage portals                      |

### Shaper / Adapter

Shapers focus on influencing and shaping the evolution of the industry structure and environment to their advantage. They leverage key platform technologies, manage increasing returns dynamics, and mobilize economic incentives to accelerate web growth and create lock-in effects.

Adapters quickly respond to changes happening in the environment. Adapters establish early positions in promising networks, aggressively compete for market share within those networks, and align themselves with key shaper companies. Rather than shaping the landscape, adapters skillfully navigate and capitalize on emerging opportunities within the existing structures created by the shapers.

While shapers proactively shape the playing field, adapters flexibly adapt and thrive within that changing landscape shaped by others.

### Customer relationship business / Product innovation and commercialization business / Infrastructure management business

| business | example | description | 
|-|-|-|
| Customer relationship | retailers like Walmart focusing on attracting and retaining customers | invest heavily in service and economies of scope to maximize customer lifetime value | 
| Product innovation and commercialization | Apple conceiving new products and bringing them to market quickly | prioritize speed-to-market and rewarding creative talent |
| Infrastructure management | logistics companies like FedEx managing high-volume operational facilities efficiently at scale | pursue economies of scale through standardization to drive down unit costs in high-volume operations. While often bundled together historically, these business types have conflicting economics, cultures and competitive requirements. |

### Autonomous innovations / Systemic innovations

Autonomous innovations are those that can be independently pursued without relying on other innovations or actors, such as developing a new turbocharger to increase horsepower. 

Systemic innovations require a series of interdependent and complementary innovations to realize their full benefits, such as Polaroid needing to create a new camera and film technology together.

Virtual organizations are better suited for pursuing autonomous innovations at the edges of the organization, leveraging external partnerships and alliances. However, they face challenges in coordinating systemic innovations that require tighter integration and control across organizational boundaries. 

### Virtual organization / Integrated companies

Virtual organizations in the network economy are geographically distributed networks of independent entities collaborating remotely through communication technologies. They concentrate on core competencies while outsourcing non-core activities, relying heavily on trust and flexibility to rapidly adapt to changing conditions. Extensive use of IT enables seamless coordination and information sharing across these fluid virtual structures.

Integrated companies prioritize vertical integration, coordinating most value-adding activities internally through well-defined hierarchies and standardized processes to achieve scale economies. While virtual models thrive on agility and external partnerships, integrated firms emphasize control, self-sufficiency, and internal efficiencies to deliver customer value.

The choice depends on whether innovations are autonomous or systemic, with virtual setups better suited for autonomous innovations and integrated companies advantageous for systemic innovations requiring tighter cross-functional coordination.

| Virtual Organizations | Integrated Companies |
|------------------------|----------------------|
| Geographically distributed networks | Vertically integrated structures |
| Collaborate remotely through communication technologies | Coordinate activities internally |
| Concentrate on core competencies | Perform most value-adding activities in-house |
| Outsource non-core activities to partners | Self-sufficient in delivering customer value |
| Rely on trust and flexibility | Well-defined hierarchies and standardized processes |
| Rapidly adapt to changing conditions | Achieve economies of scale through standardization |
| Extensive use of IT for coordination and information sharing | Emphasize control and internal efficiencies |
| Fluid, flexible structures | Rigid, hierarchical structures |
| Thrive on agility and external partnerships | Prioritize self-sufficiency and control |
| Suitable for autonomous innovations | Advantageous for systemic innovations requiring tight coordination |

### Unbundling the unbundled

In the network economy, business activities should be unbundled when separating monopolistic network functions from competitive segments is necessary to promote fair competition and prevent discrimination.

"Unbundling the unbundled" means further modularizing and outsourcing business processes beyond the initial separation of activities. This offers increased flexibility and specialization but requires new coordination mechanisms to manage the complexity of the value web. The optimal degree of unbundling depends on balancing flexibility, economies of scope, and coordination costs within each organization.

Focusing on specific areas can lead to significant success in the digital economy. This strategy allows companies to excel in niche markets and adapt to changing industry dynamics more effectively.

### Sustaining innovations / Disruptive innovations

Sustaining innovation focuses on incrementally improving existing products or services to serve an organization's existing customer base, such as Apple releasing updated iPhone models each year with enhanced features.

Disruptive innovation creates entirely new markets and value networks by introducing affordable and accessible offerings that initially underperform compared to existing products but eventually displace established competitors, such as Netflix's transition from DVD rentals to streaming video which disrupted the traditional video rental market dominated by Blockbuster.

While Apple exemplifies sustaining innovation in the smartphone industry, companies like Uber (ride-sharing) and Airbnb (home rentals) are disruptors that have transformed their respective markets through disruptive innovations.

| Innovation Type | Description | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sustaining Innovations | Incremental improvements to existing products or services to better serve an organization's current customer base | Apple releasing updated iPhone models annually with enhanced features and performance |
| Disruptive Innovations | Create entirely new markets and value networks by providing simplicity, affordability, and accessibility to non-consumers or overlooked segments, disrupting established players | Netflix disrupting home video rental with online streaming, Uber disrupting taxis with ride-sharing app, Amazon disrupting retail with e-commerce and logistics capabilities |

### Low-end disruption / New-market disruption / Top-down disruption

Low-end disruption occurs when a company introduces a simpler, more affordable product or service that initially underperforms compared to existing offerings but is good enough for the low-end of the market. Over time, the disruptor improves its offering to eventually meet the needs of more demanding customers, displacing established competitors.

New-market disruption happens when a company creates an entirely new market by offering a simple, accessible product or service to a segment of non-consumers who previously lacked the skills, wealth or access to existing products.

Top-down disruption refers to when an established company leverages new technology or a new business model to introduce a higher-quality but more affordable product that disrupts the incumbents from above, rather than from the low-end of the market. 

| Type of Disruption | Disruptor | Target Market | Approach | Impact |
|---------------------|------------|----------------|----------|--------|
| Low-end Disruption | Existing company | Low-end of existing market | Introduces simpler, more affordable product initially underperforming | Over time, improves offering to meet needs of more demanding customers, displacing incumbents |
| New-market Disruption | New entrant | Non-consumers lacking skills, wealth or access | Creates entirely new market with simple, accessible product | Serves previously unserved segment |
| Top-down Disruption | Established company | Existing high-end market | Leverages new tech or business model for higher-quality, affordable product | Disrupts incumbents from above, not low-end |

### E-business model

A business model needs to address:
- The revenue and product aspects,
- The business actor and network aspects,
- The marketing aspects of a business."

| Revenue Model | Description | Example |
|---------------|-------------|---------|
| Commission | Fees levied on transactions based on the size of the transaction. | Uber charges a commission on each ride booked through its platform |
| Advertising | Revenue generated by charging for advertising rather than by charging the end users for using the website. | Google generates most of its revenue through targeted ads linked to search terms and websites |
| Mark-up | Primary source of revenue from mark-up on the products sold via the Internet. | Amazon sells many products directly to consumers at a markup |
| Production | Manufacturer sells to customers directly via the Internet. | Tesla sells its electric vehicles directly to consumers online and through its own stores, avoiding dealer margins |
| Referral-based | Firms rely on fees for steering visitors to another company's site. | Websites like Wirecutter earn referral fees for steering readers to retailers |
| Subscription-based | Company charges users a flat rate on a periodic basis for certain services. | Netflix generates revenue through monthly subscription fees for its streaming service |
| Fee-for-service based | Activities are metered and users pay for what they consume, known as the utility model. | Utilities like electricity and gas companies charge customers based on their metered usage |

Hagel's web strategy emphasizes leveraging web services to drive profits and growth in the knowledge-based, network economy by accelerating capability building, tapping into network effects, shifting from products to services, embracing disruptive innovation, and cultivating specialized capabilities. This has led to the deconstruction of traditional vertically integrated value chains, replaced by flexible coordination mechanisms and new business models.

Virtual organizations, while offering access to global talent, flexibility, cost savings, and knowledge transfer, face challenges such as lack of camaraderie, communication issues, delegation problems, work ethic differences, and personal connection barriers. Navigating these qualities and difficulties is crucial for virtual organizations to succeed, requiring effective leadership, clear communication, structured workflows, and fostering team camaraderie.
