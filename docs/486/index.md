# CPIS-486 E-commerce strategies

#### Adpater

#### Shaper

Shapers focus on influencing and shaping the evolution of the industry structure and environment to their advantage. They leverage key platform technologies, manage increasing returns dynamics, and mobilize economic incentives to accelerate web growth and create lock-in effects.

Adapters quickly respond to changes happening in the environment. Adapters establish early positions in promising networks, aggressively compete for market share within those networks, and align themselves with key shaper companies. Rather than shaping the landscape, adapters skillfully navigate and capitalize on emerging opportunities within the existing structures created by the shapers.

While shapers proactively shape the playing field, adapters flexibly adapt and thrive within that changing landscape shaped by others.

#### Customer relationship business

#### Product innovation and commercialization business

#### Infrastructure management business

| business | example | description | 
|-|-|-|
| Customer relationship | retailers like Walmart focusing on attracting and retaining customers | invest heavily in service and economies of scope to maximize customer lifetime value | 
| Product innovation and commercialization | Apple conceiving new products and bringing them to market quickly | prioritize speed-to-market and rewarding creative talent |
| Infrastructure management | logistics companies like FedEx managing high-volume operational facilities efficiently at scale | pursue economies of scale through standardization to drive down unit costs in high-volume operations. While often bundled together historically, these business types have conflicting economics, cultures and competitive requirements. |

#### Autonomous innovations

#### Systemic innovations

Autonomous innovations are those that can be independently pursued without relying on other innovations or actors, such as developing a new turbocharger to increase horsepower. 

Systemic innovations require a series of interdependent and complementary innovations to realize their full benefits, such as Polaroid needing to create a new camera and film technology together.

Virtual organizations are better suited for pursuing autonomous innovations at the edges of the organization, leveraging external partnerships and alliances. However, they face challenges in coordinating systemic innovations that require tighter integration and control across organizational boundaries. 

#### Virtual organization and integrated companies

Virtual organizations in the network economy are geographically distributed networks of independent entities collaborating remotely through communication technologies. They concentrate on core competencies while outsourcing non-core activities, relying heavily on trust and flexibility to rapidly adapt to changing conditions. Extensive use of IT enables seamless coordination and information sharing across these fluid virtual structures.

Integrated companies prioritize vertical integration, coordinating most value-adding activities internally through well-defined hierarchies and standardized processes to achieve scale economies. While virtual models thrive on agility and external partnerships, integrated firms emphasize control, self-sufficiency, and internal efficiencies to deliver customer value.

The choice depends on whether innovations are autonomous or systemic, with virtual setups better suited for autonomous innovations and integrated companies advantageous for systemic innovations requiring tighter cross-functional coordination.

| Virtual Organizations | Integrated Companies |
|------------------------|----------------------|
| Geographically distributed networks | Vertically integrated structures |
| Collaborate remotely through communication technologies | Coordinate activities internally |
| Concentrate on core competencies | Perform most value-adding activities in-house |
| Outsource non-core activities to partners | Self-sufficient in delivering customer value |
| Rely on trust and flexibility | Well-defined hierarchies and standardized processes |
| Rapidly adapt to changing conditions | Achieve economies of scale through standardization |
| Extensive use of IT for coordination and information sharing | Emphasize control and internal efficiencies |
| Fluid, flexible structures | Rigid, hierarchical structures |
| Thrive on agility and external partnerships | Prioritize self-sufficiency and control |
| Suitable for autonomous innovations | Advantageous for systemic innovations requiring tight coordination |

#### Sustaining innovations

#### Disruptive innovations

Sustaining innovation focuses on incrementally improving existing products or services to serve an organization's existing customer base, such as Apple releasing updated iPhone models each year with enhanced features.

Disruptive innovation creates entirely new markets and value networks by introducing affordable and accessible offerings that initially underperform compared to existing products but eventually displace established competitors, such as Netflix's transition from DVD rentals to streaming video which disrupted the traditional video rental market dominated by Blockbuster.

While Apple exemplifies sustaining innovation in the smartphone industry, companies like Uber (ride-sharing) and Airbnb (home rentals) are disruptors that have transformed their respective markets through disruptive innovations.

| Innovation Type | Description | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sustaining Innovations | Incremental improvements to existing products or services to better serve an organization's current customer base | Apple releasing updated iPhone models annually with enhanced features and performance |
| Disruptive Innovations | Create entirely new markets and value networks by providing simplicity, affordability, and accessibility to non-consumers or overlooked segments, disrupting established players | Netflix disrupting home video rental with online streaming, Uber disrupting taxis with ride-sharing app, Amazon disrupting retail with e-commerce and logistics capabilities |

Low-end disruption

New-market disruption

Top-down disruption

Low-end disruption occurs when a company introduces a simpler, more affordable product or service that initially underperforms compared to existing offerings but is good enough for the low-end of the market. Over time, the disruptor improves its offering to eventually meet the needs of more demanding customers, displacing established competitors.

New-market disruption happens when a company creates an entirely new market by offering a simple, accessible product or service to a segment of non-consumers who previously lacked the skills, wealth or access to existing products.

Top-down disruption refers to when an established company leverages new technology or a new business model to introduce a higher-quality but more affordable product that disrupts the incumbents from above, rather than from the low-end of the market. 

| Type of Disruption | Disruptor | Target Market | Approach | Impact |
|---------------------|------------|----------------|----------|--------|
| Low-end Disruption | Existing company | Low-end of existing market | Introduces simpler, more affordable product initially underperforming | Over time, improves offering to meet needs of more demanding customers, displacing incumbents |
| New-market Disruption | New entrant | Non-consumers lacking skills, wealth or access | Creates entirely new market with simple, accessible product | Serves previously unserved segment |
| Top-down Disruption | Established company | Existing high-end market | Leverages new tech or business model for higher-quality, affordable product | Disrupts incumbents from above, not low-end |

#### E-business model

A business model needs to address:
- The revenue and product aspects,
- The business actor and network aspects,
- The marketing aspects of a business."

Revenue models

1. Commission - fees levied on transactions based on the size of the transaction.
2. Advertising - revenue generated by charging for advertising rather than by charging the end users for using the website.
3. Mark-up - the primary source of revenue from mark-up on the products it sells via the Internet.
4. Production - which Rappa called the manufacturing model, where the manufacturer sells to the customers directly via the Internet.
5. Referral-based - firms rely on fees for steering visitors to another company's site.
6. Subscription-based - the company charges users a flat rate on a periodic basis for certain services.
7. Fee-for-service based - activities are metered and the users pay for what they consume, which Rappa calls the utility model.

Hagel's web strategy emphasizes leveraging web services to drive profits and growth in the knowledge-based, network economy by accelerating capability building, tapping into network effects, shifting from products to services, embracing disruptive innovation, and cultivating specialized capabilities. This has led to the deconstruction of traditional vertically integrated value chains, replaced by flexible coordination mechanisms and new business models.

Virtual organizations, while offering access to global talent, flexibility, cost savings, and knowledge transfer, face challenges such as lack of camaraderie, communication issues, delegation problems, work ethic differences, and personal connection barriers. Navigating these qualities and difficulties is crucial for virtual organizations to succeed, requiring effective leadership, clear communication, structured workflows, and fostering team camaraderie.
