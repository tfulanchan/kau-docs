## Supervised learning

Supervised learning is a machine learning approach that’s defined by its use of labelled datasets. These datasets are designed to train or “supervise” algorithms into classifying data or predicting outcomes accurately. 

## Examples of classification in various domains

| Problem | Features | Application |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Medical Diagnosis | Patient's medical history, test results, age, gender, etc. | Identifying diseases like diabetes, cancer, or heart conditions based on patient data. |
| Credit Scoring | Credit history, income, employment status, debt, etc. | Banks and financial institutions use this to assess the risk associated with providing loans. |
| Image Classification | Pixel values of the image, possibly augmented with deep learning features. | Identifying objects in images for self-driving cars, medical imaging, facial recognition, etc. |
| Sentiment Analysis | Text content, word frequencies, sentiment-related features. | Analysing social media posts, reviews, or customer feedback to understand public sentiment. |
| Handwriting Recognition | Pixel values of handwritten images. | Optical character recognition (OCR) systems used in digitizing documents and automating data entry. |
| Fraud Detection | Transaction history, amounts, locations, time of day, etc. | Banks and credit card companies use this to detect unauthorized or suspicious activities. |



## Examples of regression in various domains

| Problem | Features | Application |
| --- | --- | --- |
| House Price Prediction | Square footage, number of bedrooms, location, amenities, etc. | Real estate agents and platforms use this to estimate property values. |
| Temperature Forecasting | Historical temperature, humidity, time of day, etc. | Meteorological agencies use this for weather forecasting. |
| Stock Price Prediction | Historical stock prices, trading volume, economic indicators, etc. | Investors use these predictions to make trading decisions. |
| Healthcare Cost Prediction | Age, gender, medical history, procedures, location, etc. | Insurance companies use this to estimate costs for policyholders. |
| Energy Consumption Forecasting | Historical energy usage, weather conditions, time of day, etc. | Utilities plan energy generation and distribution based on these predictions. |
| GPA Prediction | Study hours, attendance, prior grades, extracurricular activities, etc. | Educational institutions use this to identify students who might need additional support. |

## Challenges of supervised learning

Although supervised learning can offer businesses advantages, such as deep data insights and improved automation, there are some challenges when building sustainable supervised learning models. The following are some of these challenges:

+ Supervised learning models can require certain levels of expertise to structure accurately.

+ Training supervised learning models can be very time intensive.

+ Datasets can have a higher likelihood of human error, resulting in algorithms learning incorrectly.

+ Unlike unsupervised learning models, supervised learning cannot cluster or classify data on its own.

## Unsupervised learning

Unsupervised learning uses machine learning algorithms to analyse and cluster unlabelled data sets. These algorithms discover hidden patterns in data without the need for human intervention.

1 Clustering

Clustering is a technique for grouping unlabelled data based on their similarities or differences

2 Dimensionality reduction

Dimensionality reduction is a learning technique used when the number of features  (or dimensions) in a given dataset is too high

## Examples of clustering in various domains

| Problem | Features | Application |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Customer Segmentation | Purchase history, demographics, browsing behaviour, etc. | Businesses use these segments for targeted marketing and personalized recommendations. |
| Image Segmentation | Pixel values, colour histograms, texture features. | Medical imaging, object detection, and computer vision tasks. |
| Social Network Analysis | Connections between individuals, shared interests, interactions. | Understanding network structure, influence spread, and community dynamics. |
| Document Clustering | Text content, word frequencies. | Organizing news articles, customer reviews, and research papers. |
| Genomic Data Analysis | Gene expression levels under different conditions. | Understanding gene interactions and identifying biomarkers. |
| Market Basket Analysis | Purchased items in transactions | Retailers use this for product recommendations and store layout optimization. |

## Challenges of unsupervised learning

While unsupervised learning has many benefits, some challenges can occur when it allows machine learning models to execute without any human intervention. Some of these challenges can include:

+ Computational complexity due to a high volume of training data

+ Longer training times

+ Higher risk of inaccurate results

+ Human intervention to validate output variables

+ Lack of transparency into the basis on which data was clustered

##  Reinforcement learning

Reinforcement learning is a subfield of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. Reinforcement learning involves learning through trial and error based on feedback from the environment.

## Applications of reinforcement learning

Learning Objectives: The learning objectives can include safe and efficient navigation, obeying traffic rules, avoiding collisions, adapting to traffic conditions, and minimizing travel time.

Reward Design:

Positive rewards can be given for safe driving, staying within lanes, obeying traffic signals, and reaching a destination.

Negative rewards can be assigned for collisions, violating traffic rules, abrupt maneuvers, and driving too close to other vehicles.

State Representation: The car's state can be represented by various factors, such as its position, speed, acceleration, orientation, distances to surrounding objects, and traffic conditions.

Action Space: The action space refers to the possible control inputs that the self-driving car can apply, such as accelerating, braking, steering, and changing lanes.

Environment: The environment for a self-driving car consists of the road, other vehicles, pedestrians, and traffic signals.

## Supervised vs. unsupervised vs. reinforcement

| Learning Type | Data source | Goal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Supervised learning | Training a model on labelled data. | The goal is to learn a mapping from input features to the correct output labels. |
| Unsupervised learning | Training a model on unlabelled data. | The goal is to discover patterns, structures, or relationships within the data. |
| Reinforcement learning | Training a model through interactions with an environment. | The model learns to take actions in order to maximize a reward signal over time. |
