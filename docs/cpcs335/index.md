| Supervised Learning | <ul><li>Learns from labeled data (input-output pairs) </li><li>Goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs </li><li>Used for tasks like classification and regression </li></ul> | <ul><li>Requires labeled data, which can be time-consuming and expensive to obtain </li><li>Performance is limited by the quality and quantity of labeled data </li></ul> |
| Unsupervised Learning | <ul><li>Learns from unlabeled data </li><li>Goal is to discover patterns, structures, or relationships within the data </li><li>Used for tasks like clustering, dimensionality reduction, and association rule mining </li></ul> | <ul><li>Lack of labeled data can lead to less accurate results compared to supervised learning </li><li>Interpretation of results may require human intervention </li></ul> |
| Reinforcement Learning | <ul><li>Learns through interactions with an environment </li><li>Goal is to learn a policy that maximizes cumulative rewards over time </li><li>Used in scenarios where an agent must learn to navigate and make decisions in dynamic environments </li></ul> | <ul><li>Can be computationally expensive and require a large number of iterations to converge </li><li>Designing an appropriate reward function can be challenging </li></ul> |
