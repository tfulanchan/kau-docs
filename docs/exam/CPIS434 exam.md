# Final Exam

Chapter  Architecture and Infrastructure

Mohawk Paper

•What did Mohawk paper see as an opportunity?

•What did they do?

•What was the result?

From Vision to Implementation

•Architecture translates strategy into infrastructure

•Home architect develops a blueprint of a proposed house —based on customer

•Business architect develops a blueprint of a company’s  proposed systems —based on strategy

•This “blueprint” is used for translating business strategy  into a plan for IS.

•The IT infrastructure is everything that supports the flow and processing of information (hardware, software, data, and networks).

From abstract to concrete –building vs. IT

The Manager’s Role


•Must understand what to expect from IT  architecture and infrastructure.


•Must clearly communicate business vision.


•May need to modify the plans if IT cannot  realistically support them.


•Manager MUST be involved in the decision making  process.



From Strategy to Architecture


•Manager starts out with a strategy.


•Strategy is used to develop more specific goals


•Business requirements must be determined for each  goal so the architect knows what IS must accomplish.



Example


•Strategy: Be a customer -oriented company


•Goal:  -day money back guarantee


•Business Requirement: ability to track purchases


•Business Requirement: ability to track problems


•Goal: Answer email questions within  hours


•Business Requirement: Ability to handle the volume




From Business Requirements to Architecture


The Example Continues


•Business Requirement: Ability to track purchases


•Architectural Requirement: 


•Database that can handle all details of more than a -day history



From Architecture to Infrastructure


•Adds more detail to the architectural plan.


•actual hardware, software, data, and networking


•Components need coherent combination



From Architecture to Infrastructure



The Example Continues


➤Architectural Requirement: Database that can handle all details of more than a  -day history


➤Functional Specification: be able to hold , customer records,  fields; be able to insert  records per hour


➤Hardware specification:  gigaherz Core  Duo Server


➤Hardware specification: half terabyte RAID level  hard drive array


➤Software specification: Apache operating system


➤Software specification: My SQL database


➤Data protocol: IP (internet protocol)



A Framework for the Translation


•Considerations for moving from strategy to architecture to infrastructure:


•Hardware –physical components


•Software –programs


•Network –software and hardware


•Data –utmost concern: data quantity & format


•What -who -where is a useful framework

Common IT Architecture Configurations


•Centralized architecture –All purchases, support, and management from data center


•Decentralized architecture –uses multiple servers perhaps in different locations


•Service -Oriented architecture –uses small chunks of functionality to build applications quickly.


•Example: e -commerce shopping cart


•Software -Defined architecture –instantly reconfigures under load or surplus




Software -Defined Architecture


•Birdbath example: Thanks to the Oprah Winfrey show, sales went from  per month to ,.


•Increased sales seen as an attack with static system


•Adaptive system warns other parts of sales fluctuations, preventing lost sales


•Famous Coffee Shop example: 


•WiFi shares lines with production systems; problems in one can be shunted to another


•Also, coffee bean automatic reordering; spot market purchasing


•High potential for decreasing costs




New Technologies


•Peer to peer architecture: Allows networked computers to share resources without a central server


•Wireless (mobile) infrastructure: allows communication without laying wires


•Web -based architecture: places information on web servers connected to the Internet


•Cloud -based architecture: places both data and processing methods on servers on the Internet, accessible anywhere


•Capacity -on-demand: enables firms to make available more processing capacity or storage when needed


===========

Architectural Principles

Fundamental beliefs about how the architecture should function




Enterprise Architecture (EA)


•The “blueprint” for all IS and interrelationships in the firm


•Four key elements:
    
•Core business processes
    
•Shared data
    
•Linking and automation technologies
    
•Customer groups


•One example is TOGAF (The Open Group Architecture Foundation)


•Methodology and set of resources for developing an EA


•Specifications are public


•Business and IT leaders develop EA together




Virtualization and Cloud Computing


•Cloud computing refers to:


•Resources that are available “on the Internet”


•No software for the organization to develop or install (only web browser)


•No data for the organization to store (it stays somewhere in the Internet “cloud”)


•The provider keeps and safeguards programs and data


•This is “infrastructure as a service” (IaaS)


•Also available is SaaS (Software as a service)


•And there is also PaaS (Platform as a service)


•Utility Computing: Pay only for what you use (like power, lights) Source: Computerworld Aug , 




Examples of Systems Provided in the “Cloud?
”


•Just some examples


•Word processing; spreadsheeting ; email (Google Docs: $ per user annually)


•Buying/selling Financial services (Salesforce.com)


•Email (Gmail, Hotmail)


•Social networking (Facebook)


•Business networking (LinkedIn)


•Music (iTunes)


•Storage (Amazon’s Simple Storage Service —S)


•A server (Amazon’s Elastic Compute Cloud —EC)

Source: Computerworld Aug ,  and CRN website




Assessing Strategic Timeframe


•Varies from industry to industry


•Level of commitment to fixed resources


•Maturity of the industry


•Cyclicality


•Barriers to entry


•Also varies from firm to firm


•Management’s reliance on IT


•Rate of advances affecting the IT management counts on




Assessing Adaptability


•Guidelines for planning adaptable IT architecture and infrastructure


•Plan for applications and systems that are independent and loosely coupled


•Set clear boundaries between infrastructure components


•When designing a network architecture, provide access to all users when it makes sense to do so




Assessing Scalability


•Scalability refers to how well a component can adapt to increased or decreased demand


•Needs are determined by:


•Projections of growth


•How architecture must support growth


•What happens if growth is much higher than projected


•What happens if there is no growth




Other Assessments


•Standardization –Common, shared standards are easy to plug in


•Maintainability –Can the infrastructure be maintained?




•Security –Decentralized architecture is more difficult to secure



Assessing Financial Issues

• Quantify expected return on investment

• Can be difficult to quantify

• Steps 

• Quantify costs

• Determine life cycles of components

• Quantify benefits

• Quantify risks

• Consider ongoing dollar costs and benefits

Chapter  The Business of IT


The Horner/Alcoa Story

•High -performing tech worker —almost dismissed 
as CIO

•What were the issues?


•What did they expect from him?


•What did he deliver at first?


•What change did he make to become more 
valuable to Alcoa?





The Alcoa lesson: Business Demands

•IT offerings need to be aligned with business 
demands

•IT complexities should be translated to business 
needs




Merlyn’s Business -IT Maturity Model




What a Manager Can Expect From
the IT Organization
A manager typically can expect some level of support in 
core activities (Figure .) –levels in parentheses
.Developing and maintaining IS ()
.Managing supplier relationships ()
.Managing data, information, and knowledge (, )
.Managing Internet and network services (, )
.Managing human resources ()
.Operating the data center ()
.Providing general support ()



What a Manager Can Expect From
the IT Organization (Cont.)
.Planning for business discontinuities ()
.Innovating current processes ()
.Establishing architecture platforms and standards. ()
.Promoting enterprise security ()
.Anticipating new technologies ()
.Participating in setting and implementing strategic 
goals ()
.Integrating social IT ()
 


What The IT Organization Does Not Do

•Does not perform core business functions such as:

•Selling

•Manufacturing

•Accounting.

•Does not set business strategy.

•General managers must not delegate critical 
technology decisions.
 


Chief Information Officer (CIO) 
The Senior -Most IT Executive

•Responsible for technology vision

•Leads design, development, implementation, and 
management of IT initiatives

•Is a business technology strategist or strategic 
business leader

•Uses technology as the core tool in 

•creating competitive advantage 

•aligning business and IT strategies
 


CIO’s Focus

•CIO’s focus has shifted:

•From efficiency to effectiveness in a constantly 
changing/competitive marketplace

•Formerly: reported to the CFO. Now: reports to 
the CEO.

•Shift over time towards helping executive team 
formulate business strategy




CTO, CPO, and Other Roles

•CIO Can’t have allskills —can’t know everything!

•Other roles are important:

•CTO: Chief Technology Officer (tracks technologies)

•CKO: Chief Knowledge Officer

•CDO: Chief Data Officer

•CAO: Chief Analytics Officer

•CTO: Chief Telecommunications Officer

•CNO: Chief Network Officer

•CRO: Chief Resource Officer

•CISO: Chief Information Security Officer

•CPO: Chief Privacy Officer

•CMO: Chief Mobility Officer

•CSMO: Chief Social Media Officer




So Who Should Make the Decisions?


•Ross & Weill say 

•The CEO should not make those decisions alone

•C-level executives should not even make those 
decisions

•Input is needed from both IT and the business units 
alike

•Steering (or Executive) Committee solution




Building a Business Case -
Components

•Executive Summary

•Overview and Introduction

•Assumptions and Rationale

•Project Summary

•Financial Discussion and Analysis

•Benefits and Business Impacts

•Schedule and Milestones

•Risk and Contingency Analysis

•Conclusion and Recommendation

•Appendices

Customers seem happierSales improved by $ k; costs 
decreased by $ k after change
Facebook page likes; number of chats;
Customer satisfaction scores moved from
. to . (out of )Converted  calls per day to chats;
reaching  more customers per day




IT Portfolio Management

•IT investments should be managed as any other 
investment.

•Evaluate and approve IT investments as they relate 
to other potential investments of all kinds

•Goals: 

•Pick the right mix of investments

•Invest in the most valuable IT initiatives




Asset Classes

•Weill and Aral say that there are four asset classes 
of IT investments:

•Transactional systems –systems that streamline or cut 
costs on business operations.

•Informational systems –any system that provides 
information used to control, manage, communicate, 
analyze or collaborate.

•Strategic systems –any system used to gain competitive 
advantage in the marketplace.

•Infrastructure systems –the base foundation or shared 
IT services used for multiple applications.

Valuing IT Investments

•Soft benefits, such as the ability to make future 
decisions, make it difficult to measure the payback of 
IT investment

•IT is expensive, thus under close scrutiny.  

•IT is complex; calculating the costs is an art, not a science.  

•Payback period for infrastructure is much longer than other 
types of capital investments.  

•With necessary systems (due to laws, etc.), the payback 
period cannot be calculated 

•Many valuation methods are available …




Valuation Method Description
Return on Investment (ROI) ROI= 𝑅𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑢𝑒 −𝐼𝑛𝑣𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡
𝐼𝑛𝑣𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡
Net Present Value (NPV) Discount the costs and benefits for each year of the 
system’s lifetime using present value factor

+𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡 𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑠
Economic Value Added (EVA) EVA = net operating profit after taxes 
(capital x cost of capital)
Payback Analysis Time that will lapse before accrued benefits overtake 
accrued and continuing costs
Internal Rate of Return (IRR) Return of the IT investment compared to the corporate 
policy on rate of return
Weighted Scoring Methods Costs and revenues/savings are weighted based on their 
strategic importance, accuracy/confidence, other 
opportunitiesFinancial Valuation Methods




IT Investment Monitoring

•Old saying: “If you can ’t measure it, you can ’t 
manage it ”

•Management needs to achieve organizational 
benefits from IT investments

•Must agree upon a set of metrics for monitoring IT 
investments.

•Often financial in nature (ROI, NPV, etc.).




The Balanced Scorecard

•Focuses attention on the organization’s value 
drivers (which include financial performance).

•Assesses the full impact of corporate strategies on 
customers and workforce, as well as financial 
performance.

•Allows managers to look at a business from four 
related perspectives :




How do our 
customers see 
us?
At what must we 
excel?

Can we continue 
to improve and 
create value?
How do we look 
to shareholders?
The Four Balanced Scorecard perspectives




The IT Balanced Scorecard

•Using it within the MIS department helps senior IS 
managers 

•Understand their organization’s performance

•Measure it in a way that supports its business strategy

•Linked to the corporate scorecard

•By ensuring that the measures used by IT are those that 
support the corporate goals.




IT Dashboards

•Snapshot of metrics at a given point in time (often 
“right now”)

•Offer “at a glance” idea of how things are going

•Often colors depict conditions:

•Areas with problems (red)

•Areas in good shape (green)

•In-between or average (yellow)




Sample Black & White Dashboard




ITDashboard.gov




Architecture for Dashboards




Funding the IT department 

•How are costs of design, development, delivery 
and maintenance of IT systems recovered (or 
simply covered)?



•Chargeback 

•Allocation  

•Corporate budget

•The first two are done for management reasons

•The latter covers costs using corporate coffers




Funding 
MethodDescription Why do it?

Why not do it?

Chargeback Charges are 
calculated based 
on actual usageFairest method for 
recovering costs 
since it is based on 
actual usageMust collect 
details on usage; 
often expensive 
and difficult
Allocation Expenditures are 
divided by non -
usage basis 
(revenues, headcount, etc. )Less bookkeeping 
for IT Users can 
question rates & 
basis of allocation

Corporate 
BudgetCorporate 
allocates funds to 
IT in annual

businesses.
No rates to 
compute. 
Encourages use of 
new technologies.Have to compete 
with all other 
budgeted items 
for funds.
Potential for 
overspending.Comparison of IT funding methods




How to Determine Cost

•Basic method: add up costs of hardware, software, 
network, and people involved in IS.

•Real cost is not always easy to determine

•Remains a mystery for many firms




Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)

•Has become the industry standard.

•Looks beyond initial capital investments to include 
costs often forgotten. For example:

•technical support

•administration 

•training

•Estimates total annual costs per user for each 
potential infrastructure choice.

•Provide the best foundation for comparing to 
other IT and non -IT investments.




TCO Component Breakdown 

•Shared components (servers and printers): 

•TCO divided among all users who access each

•When only certain groups of users possess certain 
components, segment the hardware analysis by 
platform.

•Soft costs, such as technical support, 
administration, and training are important to 
include




Soft Cost Areas Example Components of Cost Source
Technical support Hardware phone support Call center
In-person hardware troubleshooting IT operations
Hardware hot swaps IT operations
Physical hardware repair IT operations

Chapter  Governance of the Information Systems Organization


Learning Objectives

•Understand how governance structures define 
how decisions are made

•Describe governance based on organization 
structure, decision rights, and control

•Discuss examples and strategies for 
implementation.




Intel’s Transformation

•Huge performance improvements between  
and 

•Was it due to a spending increase?


•Intel ’s evolution

• : Centralized IT

• : Protect Era –lockdown (SOX & virus)

• : Protect to Enable Era (BYOD pressure)




Intel Reached Level :
.Developing programs and delivering services
.Contributing business value
.Transforming the firm
Previously: categorized problems as “business ” or “IT”
Now: Integrated solutions are the only way




IT Governance

•Governance (in business) is all about making 
decisions that

•Define expectations , 

•Grant authority, or 

•Ensure performance. 

•Empowerment and monitoring will help align 
behavior with business goals.

•Empowerment: granting the right to make decisions.

•Monitoring: evaluating performance .



IT Governance

•IT governance focuses on how decision rights can 
be distributed differently to facilitate three 
possible modes of decision making:

•centralized, 

•decentralized, or 

•hybrid

•Organizational structure plays a major role .
 


Four Perspectives

•Traditional –Centralized vs decentralized

•Accountability and allocation of decision rights

•Ecosystem

•Control structures from legislation
 


Centralized vs. Decentralized 
Organizational Structures

•Centralized –bring together all staff, hardware, 
software, data, and processing into a single location.

•Decentralized –the components in the centralized 
structure are scattered in different locations to 
address local business needs.

•Federalism –a hybrid of centralized and 
decentralized structures.
 


Organizational continuum


Federalism

•Most companies would like to achieve the 
advantages of both centralization and 
decentralization.

•Leads to federalism

•Distributes, power,  hardware, software, data and 
personnel  

•Between a central IS group and IS in business units

•A hybrid approach

•Some decisions centralized; some decentralized




Federal IT

•Centralized: . %

•Decentralized: . %

•Federated: . %

Political Archetypes (Weill & Ross)

•Archetypes label the combinations of people who 
either provide information or have key IT decision 
rights

•Business monarchy, IT monarchy, feudal, federal, IT 
duopoly, and anarchy.

•Decisions can be made at several levels in the 
organization (Figure .).

•Enterprise -wide, business unit, and region/group 
within a business unit.




Political Archetypes

•Organizations vary widely in their archetypes 
selected

•The duopoly is used by the largest portion (%) of 
organizations for IT principles decisions.

•IT monarchy is the most popular for IT architecture 
(%) and infrastructure decisions ( %).




Figure .  IT governance archetypes




Emergent Governance:
Digital Ecosystems

•Challenge a “top down ” approach

•Self-interested, self -organizing, autonomous sets 
of technologies from different sources

•Firms find opportunities to exploit new 
technologies that were not anticipated

•Good examples:

•Google Maps

•YouTube




Another Interesting Example

•Electronic Health Record

•Can connect to perhaps planned sources:

•Pharmacy

•Lab

•Insurance Company

•And can connect to unplanned sources:

•Banks –for payment

•Tax authority –for matching deductions

•Smartphone apps –for many purposes




How to Govern in this case?


•Might be difficult to impossible!

•The systems might simply emerge and evolve over 
time

•No one entity can plan these systems in their 
entirety




Mechanisms for Making Decisions

•Policies and Standards (% of firms)

•Review board or committee

•Steering committee (or governance council)

•Key stakeholders

•Can be at different levels:

•Higher level (focus on CIO effectiveness)

•Lower level (focus on details of various projects)

A Fourth –Out of a Firm ’s Control:
Legislation



Sarbanes -Oxley Act (SoX) ( )

•To increase regulatory visibility and accountability of 
public companies and their financial health

•All companies subject to the SEC are subject to SoX.

•CEOs and CFOs must personally certify and be 
accountable for their firm’s financial records and 
accounting.

•Firms must provide real -time disclosures of any events 
that may affect a firm’s stock price or financial 
performance.

• year jail term is the alternative.

•IT departments play a major role in ensuring the 
accuracy of financial data .




IT Control and Sarbanes -Oxley

•In  and  , IT departments began to 

•Identify controls, 

•Determine design effectiveness, and 

•Test to validate operation of controls




IT Control and Sarbanes -Oxley
Five IT control weaknesses are repeatedly uncovered by 
auditors:

•Failure to segregate duties within applications, and failure 
to set up new accounts and terminate old ones in a timely 
manner

•Lack of proper oversight for making application changes, 
including appointing a person to make a change and 
another to perform quality assurance on it

•Inadequate review of audit logs to not only ensure that 
systems were running smoothly but that there also was an 
audit log of the audit log

•Failure to identify abnormal transactions in a timely 
manner

•Lack of understanding of key system configurations




Frameworks for Implementing SoX

•COSO -Committee of Sponsoring Organzations of the 
Treadway Commission.

•Created three control objectives for management and 
auditors that focused on dealing with risks to internal 
control

•Operations –maintain and improve operating 
effectiveness; protect the firm ’s assets

•Compliance –with relevant laws and regulations.

•Financial reporting –in accordance with GAAP




Control Components
Five essential control components were created to 
make sure a company is meeting its objectives :

•Control environment (culture of the firm)

•Assessment of most critical risks to internal 
controls

•Control processes that outline important 
processes and guidelines

•Communication of those procedures

•Monitoring of internal controls by management 




Frameworks (continued)

•COBIT (Control Objectives for Information and Related 
Technology) 

•IT governance framework that is consistent with COSO 
controls.

•Issued in  by Information Systems Audit & Control 
Association (ISACA)

•A company must 

•Determine the processes/risks to be managed.

•Set up control objectives and KPIs (key performance indicators)

•Develop activities to reach the KPIs

•Advantages -well-suited to organizations focused on risk 
management and mitigation, and very detailed.

•Disadvantages –costly and time consuming




IS and the Implementation of SoXCompliance

•The IS department and CIO are involved with the 
implementation of SoX.

•Section  deals with management’s assessment of internal 
controls.

•Six tactics that CIOs can use in working with auditors, CFOs, 
and CEOs (Fig. .):

•Knowledge building (Build a knowledge base)

•Knowledge deployment (Disseminate knowledge to 
management.)

•Innovation directive (Organize for implementing SoX)

•Mobilization (Persuade players and subsidiaries to cooperate)

•Standardization (Negotiate agreements, build rules)

•Subsidy (Fund the costs)

•A CIO’s ability to employ these various tactics depends upon 
his/her power (relating to the SoX implementation).

Chapter  Information Systems Sourcing


Kellwood Opening Case

•Why did Kellwood outsource?


•Why did Kellwood decide to backsource after  
years?


•What was the result?




Sourcing Decision Framework 



Sourcing Options
Insourcing Outsourcing
Domestic Domestic in -house

Company produces its
products domestically without 
any outside contractsDomestic outsourcing
Company uses services supplied 
by another domestic -based 
company
Offshore Offshore in -house

company
Figure .. Different Forms of Sourcing. 
(Source: https://www.ibm.com/blog/sourcing-types/)



INSOURCING
A firm provides IS services or develops IS in its own in -
house IS organization



IT Outsourcing

•With IT, there is equipment and personnel involved

•Equipment and facilities are sold to outside 
vendors

•Personnel might be hired by outside vendors

•Services are hired from the vendors

•Common length of agreement:  years



Insourcing Drivers Insourcing Challenges
Core competencies related to 
systems
Confidentiality or sensitive 
system components or services
Time available in -house to 
develop software
Expertise for software 
development in -houseInadequate support from top 
management to acquire needed 
resources
Temptation from finding a 
reliable, competent outsourcing 
providerInsourcing drivers and challenges



Economics of Outsourcing

•Benefits:

•Sell equipment, buildings (large cash inflow)

•Downsized payroll –outsourcer hires employees

•Costs:

•Services provided for a fee

•Fixed costs usually over  -year term



Drivers Disadvantages

•Offer cost savings

•Offer service quality

•Ease transition to new 
technologies

•Offer better strategic focus

•Provide better mgmt of IS staff

•Handle peaks

•Consolidate data centers

•Infusion of cash 
•Abdication of control

•High switching costs

•Lack of technological innovation

•Loss of strategic advantage

•Reliance on outsourcer

•Problems with 
security/confidentiality

•Evaporation of cost savingsDrivers and disadvantages of outsourcing



Decisions about How to Outsource 
Successfully

•Decisions about whether or not to outsource need care and 
deliberation.

•Requires numerous other decisions about mitigating 
outsourcing risks.

•Three major decision areas: selection, contracting, and 
scope.
.Selection: find compatible providers
.Contracting:
.Try for flexible management terms
.Try for shorter ( - year) contracts
.Try for SLAs (service level agreements on performance)
.Scope –Determine if full or partial outsourcing



Offshoring

•Short for outsourcing offshore

•Definition:

•When the MIS organization uses contractor services in 
a distant land. (Insourcing offshore would be your own 
dept offshore)

•Substantial potential cost savings through reduced 
labor costs.

•Some countries offer a very well educated labor 
force.

•Implementation of quality standards:

•Six Sigma

•ISO 



Selecting an Offshoring Destination

•About  countries are now exporting software 
services and products.

•What makes countries attractive for offshoring?


•High English language proficiency.

•Countries that are peaceful/politically stable.

•Countries with lower crime rates.

•Countries with friendly relationships.

•Security and/or trade restrictions.

•Protects intellectual property

•Level of technical infrastructure available.

•Good, efficient labor force

•Once a country is selected, the particular city in that 
country needs to be assessed as well.



Selecting an Offshoring Destination

•Countries like India make an entire industry of 
offshoring.

•Software Engineering Institute’s Capability Maturity 
Model (CMM). 

•Level : the software development processes are 
immature, bordering on chaotic. 

•Level : processes are quite mature, sophisticated, 
systematic, reliable

•Indian firms are well known for their CMM Level  
software development processes, making them 
desirable



Offshore Destination -
Development Tiers
Carmel and Tjia suggest that there are three tiers of 
software exporting nations:

• Tier  : Mature .

• United Kingdom, United States, Japan, Germany, France, Canada, the 
Netherlands, Sweden, Finland, India, Ireland, Israel, China, and Russia .

• Tier : Emerging .

• Brazil, Costa Rica, South Korea, and many Eastern European countries .

• Tier : Infant .

• Cuba, Vietnam, Jordan, and  to  others.

•Tiers: based on industrial maturity, the extent of 
clustering of some critical mass of software enterprises, 
and export revenues. 

•The higher tiered countries have higher levels of skills and 
higher costs.



Farshoring

•Definition: sourcing service work to a foreign, lower -
wage country that is relatively far away in distance or 
time zone.

•Client company hopes to benefit from one or more 
ways: 

•Big cost savings due to exchange rates, labor costs, 
government subsidies, etc. 

•For the US and UK, India and China are popular

•Oddly, India and China also offshore to other 
locations



Nearshoring

•Definition: sourcing service work to a foreign, lower -wage 
country that is relatively close in distance or time zone.

•Client company hopes to benefit from one or more ways 
of being close: 

•geographically, temporally, culturally, linguistically, economically, politically or 
from historical linkages. 

•Distance and language matter.

•There are three major global nearshore clusters :

• nations around the U.S., and Canada

• countries around Western Europe

•smaller cluster of three countries in East Asia



Captive Centers

•An overseas subsidiary that is set up to serve the 
parent company.

•Alternative to offshoring or nearshoring .

•Four major stategies that are being employed: 

•Hybrid Captive –performs core business processes for parent company 
but outsources noncore work to offshore provider

•Shared Captive -performs work for both parent company and external 
customers.

•Divested captive -have a large enough scale and scope that it could be 
sold for a profit by the parent company. 

•Terminated Captive -has been shut down, usually because its inferior 
service was hurting the parent company’s reputation. 



Backsourcing

•When a company takes back in -house, previously 
outsourced, IS assets, activities, and skills.

•Partial or complete reversal

•Many companies have backsourced such as 
Continental Airlines, Cable and Wireless, and Halifax 
Bank of Scotland.

•% of outsourcing clients have had negative 
experiences and % have backsourced .

•% of  North American companies would not 
consider backsourcing .



Backsourcing Reasons

•Mirror reason for outsourcing (to reduce costs, 
increase quality of service, etc.)

•Costs were higher than expected

•Poor service

•Change in management

•Change in the way IS isperceived within the 
company

•New situations (mergers, acquisitions, etc.)



Crowdsourcing

•Definition:

•Taking a task traditionally performed by an employee or 
contractor, and 

•Outsourcing it to an undefined, generally large group of 
people, 

•In the form of an open call.

•Used by companies to increase productivity, lower 
production costs, and fill skill gaps.

•Can be used for a variety of tasks.

•Companies do not have control over the people doing 
the work.



Partnering Arrangements

•Strategic networks: arrangements made with 
other organizations to offer synergistic or 
complementary services

•Example: The Mitsui Keiretsu contains over  firms 
spanning many industries. The members use each 
others’ services and don’t compete: Toshiba, 
Fujifilm, Sony are members

•Business ecosystems (see chapter ): Informal, 
emerging relationships



Deciding Where -
Onshore, Offshore, or in the Cloud?


•New option: cloud computing 

•See chapter  for basic definitions; advantages; 
disadvantages .

•Works when outsourcing or insourcing



Cloud Computing Options

•On-premise

•Private clouds

•Data —managed by the company or offsite by a third party. 

•Community clouds.

•Cloud infrastructure is shared by several organizations 

•Supports the shared concerns of a specific community.

•Public clouds.

•Data is stored outside of the corporate data centers 

•In the cloud provider’s environment

•Hybrid clouds

•Combination of two or more other clouds.



Public Clouds -Versions

•Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).

•Infrastructure through grids or clusters of virtualized servers, 
networks, storage, and systems software.

•Designed to augment or replace the functions of an entire data 
center.

•The customer may have full control of the actual server 
configuration.

•More risk management control over the data and environment.

•Platform as a Service (PaaS).

•Virtualized servers 

•Clients can run existing applications or develop new ones

•Provider manages the hardware, operating system, and 
capacity

•Limits the enterprise risk management capabilities.



Public Clouds -Versions
Software as a Service (SaaS) or Application Service Provider (ASP).

•Software application functionality through a web browser. 

•The platform and infrastructure are fully managed by the cloud 
provider.

•If the operating system or underlying service isn’t configured 
correctly, the data at the higher application layer may be at risk. 

•The most widely known and used form of cloud computing.
Some managers shy away from cloud computing because they are 
concerned about:

•security —specifically about external threats from remote 
hackers and security breaches as the data travels to and from 
the cloud. 

•data privacy .
