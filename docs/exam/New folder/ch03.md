+ Why are they organized differently?

Cognizant Tata
  
Figure .  Organizational design variables.

Variable Description
Organizational variables

Decision rights Authority to initiate, approve, implement, and control decisions 

necessary to plan and run the business

Business processes Ordered tasks to complete key business objectives

Formal reporting 

relationshipsStructure set up to coordinate organizational units

Informal networks Mechanism, such as ad hoc groups, to coordinate and 

transfer information outside formal reporting relationships.

Control variables

Data Facts collected, stored, and used by the organization

Planning Processes by which future direction is established, 

communicated, and implemented

Performance measurement 

and evaluationMeasures to assess successful execution of plans then using 

the measures to improve the quality of work

Incentives Monetary and non -monetary devices to motivate behavior

Cultural variables

Values Implicit and explicit beliefs that underlie decisions and actions

Locus The span of culture: local, national, regional, etc.

Organizational Design
+ Different designs accomplish different goals
+ Decision rights will differ according to the design
+ Different reporting relationships and organizational structure will allocate decision rights in different 
ways
+ Four major organizational designs are:
+ Hierarchical
+ Flat
+ Matrix
+ Networked
  
Hierarchical Organizational Structure
+ Orders go down and information goes up
+ IT provides communication/memory in both 
directions
+ Also known as a bureaucracy
+ First observed by Max Weber in the Catholic Church 
and German army and applied to early factories and 
offices
+ Features include 
+ Unity of command (one boss for each person)
+ Span of control (measures the number of subordinates for 
each boss)
+ Clear lines of authority and reporting duties
  

Flat Organizational Structure
+ Also known as horizontal organizational structure
+ Features:
+ Decentralized decision making
+ Less well -defined chain of command
+ Less clear decision rights
+ Few middle managers
+ IT glues together the organization
+ IT allows rapid response; supports internal communications
  

Matrix Organization
+ Assigns employees to two or more supervisors to 
integrate multiple dimensions of a firm
+ Features:
+ Work is organized into small work teams
+ Allows organizations to concentrate on functions and 
purpose
+ IT reduces operating complexity and expense by 
allowing information to be easily shared among 
different managerial functions
+ Shortcomings:
+ Sometimes frustrating and confusing
+ Require frequent meetings 
+ Information overload
  

Networked Organizational Structure
+ Feel flat yet hierarchical
+ Work well in dynamic, unstable environments
+ Features:
+ Highly decentralized decision rights
+ Information systems replace hierarchical controls
+ Formal and informal communication networks connect 
everyone
+ Promote creativity and flexibility while maintaining 
operational process control
+ Extensive use of communication technologies and 
networks:
+ Allows coordination across functional boundaries
+ Enables quick and more accurate decision making

Emerging Organizational Forms
+ Hybrid structure (differs throughout the 
organization)
+ New forms are beginning to emerge:
+ Adaptive Organization
+ Zero -Time Organization
+ Elastic Enterprise
+ What is common among those? 
+ Flexible, agile, responsive configurations over time
+ React to changing needs
+ Use of IT and networks to enable these 
configurations
  

New Options
+ Social networks –used for:
+ Finding experts
+ Getting to know colleagues
+ Seeing who has relevant experience for projects 
across functions and geography
  

 INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND 
MANAGEMENT CONTROL 
SYSTEMS


IT Changes Management Functions
+ IT changes the way managers:
+ Monitor : new ways to track performance and 
behavior
+ Evaluate : easier to understand progress and 
performance
+ Provide Feedback : rapid feedback possible
+ Compensate & Reward : team -based efforts can be 
evaluated and complex formulas used
+ Control Processes: easier to 
+ Collect data
+ Analyze
+ Communicate results
  

Management Control
+ IS profoundly affect control
+ People & processes are monitored in ways that were 
not possible only a decade ago.
+ IS play important roles in management control 
processes
+ Data collection
+ Evaluation
+ Communication
+ IS play important roles in planning
+ Can provide the necessary data
+ Can evaluate scenarios
+ Can provide analysis and simulation tools
  

IS and Culture
+ Culture is a shared set of values and beliefs” 
+ It may be held by a group, organization, profession, 
industry, and/or nation.
+ AKA “collective programming of the mind”
+ Culture has:
+ Observable artifacts
+ Espoused values
+ Assumptions
  

Data and Information Systems
+ IS can streamline data collection through monitoring
+ IS can provide analysis tools for that data
+ Types of data include
+ Keystrokes
+ How long each task takes
+ Who is contacted during the task
+ Specific data passing through the process
+ Large data stores can be created
+ Behavioral issues can result
+ Stress from monitoring, especially if it seems not to fit the task
+ Deliberate delaying, distorting or falsifying collected data
+ Employees should know what is collected and how it is used
  

Performance Measurement, Evaluation, and IS
+ Analytics tools have proliferated, perhaps leading to information 
overload
+ Often it is less threatening/more welcomed to provide feedback 
for performance improvement than for rewards/compensation
+ Incentives and goals need to be carefully administered
+ Reward for short call duration? You’ll get short calls and perhaps unhappy 
customers
+ Reward for customer satisfaction? You’ll get happier customers but 
perhaps calls that are significantly longer than necessary
+ Be careful with incentives; you will get what you reward
+ IS can easily apply complex formulas and track performance
+ Multi -dimensional goals (e.g., % on efficiency + % on satisfaction)
+ If most work is done on teams, team performance needs to be added
  

Impacts of Culture on IT
+ Culture is a “collective programming of the 
mind” involving “shared values and beliefs”
+ Culture can:
+ Color the development of IS
+ Affect technology adoption/diffusion
+ Influence system use and outcomes
+ Impact management practices
  

Layers of Culture
.Observable artifacts –most visible layer
+ For example, dress, acronyms, awards, stories, rituals
.Espoused values: explicitly stated preferred values
+ For example: “we have a good work -life balance”
.Enacted values: reflected in actual behavior, 
sometimes inconsistent with espoused values 
+ For example “we have a good work -life balance” but 
require  -hour work days plus weekends
.Assumptions –deepest layer –unobservable; 
taken for granted
+ For example, “respect the customer”
  

Levels of Culture and IT
+ In business, culture is often applied at the following 
levels:
+ Nations
+ Organizations
+ Work groups
+ Sometimes IS developers and clients can have a 
clash in culture
+ Clients might want fast turnaround and convenience
+ Developers might want slower, more deliberate approach, 
for stability and control
  

Levels of Culture
From Leidner  and Kayworth , 
  

NATIONAL CULTURE:
GLOBE Cultural Dimensions
+ Uncertainty avoidance
+ Power distance
+ Societal collectivism
+ In-group collectivism
+ General egalitarianism
+ Assertiveness
+ Future orientation
+ Performance orientation
+ Humane orientation
  

How are IT and Culture Linked?
+ IT supports cross -cultural communication
+ People need to be aware of cultural differences 
when communicating
+ This awareness will lead to:
+ Better listening and understanding (correctly framed 
messages)
+ Searching for a solution that will be accepted widely
+ Reduced conflict
  

Application to IS Training Investments
+ Peretz & Rosenblatt found that cultural dimensions impact 
training.
+ Higher training investments were found by firms in countries with:
+ Low power distance (Germanic countries, Anglo -American countries, 
Netherlands, Israel)
+ Future orientation (some Asian countries)
+ High uncertainty avoidance (some Hispanic countries, Japan, South Korea, 
Israel, Russia)
+ Lower investments were found in firms from countries with
+ High power distance (some Asian, Latin American, and Middle Eastern 
countries)
+ Why? Perhaps to maintain power differences
+ Short -term orientation (some Anglo -American countries)
+ Low uncertainty avoidance (the UK, Ireland, Hong Kong, and Singapore)
