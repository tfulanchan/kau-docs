American Express Opening Case
+ What is the “Blue Work” program?
+ What was the strategic thrust behind the Blue Work program?
+ What are “hub,” “club,” “home,” and “roam” employees?
+ What is the role of technology in these arrangements?
+ What was the impact of Blue Work?
+ Have other firms found roaming employment useful?
  
Work Design Framework
 
IT Has Changed Work
+ IT has:
+ Created new types of work
+ Bureau of Labor Statistics: IT employment in the USA is at an all -time high
+ New jobs such as:
+ Data scientists/data miners
+ Social media managers
+ Communications managers
+ Enabled new ways to do traditional work
+ Supported new ways to manage people
  
How IT Changes Traditional Work
+ Changes the way work is done 
+ Broadens skills; faster but more tasks
+ Sometimes IT disconnects us from the tasks
+ Sometimes people can perform more strategic tasks
+ Few staff are engaged in order entry any longer
+ Crowdsourcing is now possible at very low cost ( M.Turk )
+ Changes how we communicate
+ More asynchronous and more irregular
+ Social networking has provided new opportunities for customer interaction
+ Collaboration allows a firm to look “big” with new tools  

How IT Changes Traditional Work
+ Changes decision -making 
+ Real -time information; more information available
+ Data mining can identify new insights
+ Ideas can be gleaned from social networks
+ Middle management ranks have shrunk as Leavitt/ Whisler predicted
+ Changes collaboration 
+ Work is now more team oriented; more collaborative
+ Sharing is easier than ever, using multiple methods
+ Crowdsourcing can now provide quick answers from tens, hundreds, or even thousands of people
+ We now can disconnect PLACE and TIME (Figure .)
  
Collaboration Technologies Matrix

How IT Changes Traditional Work
+ New ways to connect
+ Many employees are always connected
+ Lines between work and play are now blurred
+ For many, home technologies are better than work technologies
+ New ways to manage people
+ Behavior controls –direct supervision
+ Outcome controls –examining outcomes not actions
+ Personnel controls –pick the right person for the task
+ The digital approach provides new opportunities at any of those three levels (Fig. .)
  
Changes to Supervision/Evaluations/Compensation/Hiring

Where Work is Done: Mobile and 
Virtual Work
+ Much work can be done anywhere, anytime
+ People desire the flexibility
+ Telecommuting = teleworking = working from home or even in a coffee shop
+ Mobile workers work from anywhere (often while traveling)
+ Remote workers = telecommuters + mobile workers
+ Virtual teams include remote workers as well as those in their offices, perhaps scattered geographically
+ Virtual teams have a life cycle (Figure .)
  
Key Activities in the Life Cycle of Teams
  
Telecommuting: Global Status
+ A poll of , employees in  countries:  in  telecommute
+ When employees in  countries were asked if they need to be in the office to be productive:
+ Overall % said “yes”
+ But specific countries differed in the “yes” votes:
+ Only % in India, but
+ % in Japan
+ % in Germany
  
Driver Effect
Shift to knowledge -based work
Changing demographics and 
lifestyle preferences
New technologies with enhanced 
bandwidth
Web ubiquity
“Green” concernsDecouples work from any particular 
place
Workers desire geographic and time -
shifting flexibility 
Remotely -performed work is practical 
and cost -effective 
Can stay connected /
Reduced commuting costs; real 
estate energy consumption; travel 
costsDrivers of Remote Work and Virtual Teams
 

Advantages of Remote Work Potential Problems
Reduced stress: better ability to meet 
schedules; less distraction at work
Higher morale and lower absenteeism 
Geographic flexibility 
Higher personal productivity
Housebound individuals can join the 
workforce 
Informal DressIncreased stress: Harder to separate 
work from home life
Harder to evaluate performance
Employee may become disconnected 
from company culture 
Telecommuters are more easily 
replaced by offshore workers
Not suitable for all jobs or employees
Security might be more difficult Some advantages and disadvantages of remote work
 
Virtual Teams
+ Virtual Teams: geographically and/or organizationally dispersed coworkers:
+ Assembled using telecommunications and IT
+ Aim is to accomplish an organizational task
+ Often must be evaluated using outcome controls
+ Why are they growing in popularity?
+ Information explosion: some specialists are far away
+ Enhanced bandwidths/fast connections to outsiders
+ Technology is available to assist collaboration 
+ Less difficult to get relevant stakeholders together 
  

Challenges Virtual Teams Traditional Teams

Communications + Multiple time zones can lead to greater efficiency but can lead to communication difficulties and coordination costs (passing work).

+ Non-verbal communication is difficult to convey+ Same time zone.  
+ Scheduling is less difficult.
+ Teams may use richer communication media.
+ Technology + Proficiency is required in several technologies.+ Support for face -to-face interaction without replacing it
+ Skills and task -technology 
fit is less critical
Team Diversity + Members represent different 
organizations and/or cultures:
-Harder to establish a group identity.
-Necessary to have better com. skills
-More difficult to build trust, norms
-Impact of deadlines not always 
consistent+ More homogeneous 
members
-Easier group identity
-Easier to communicate
Challenges facing virtual teams .

Managerial Issues In Telecommuting and 
Mobile Work
+ Planning, business and support tasks must be 
redesigned to support mobile and remote workers
+ Training should be offered so all workers can 
understand the new work environment
+ Employees selected for telecommuting jobs must 
be self -starters

Managing the Challenges
+ Communications challenges
+ Policies and practices must support the work arrangements
+ Must prepare differently for meetings
+ Slides and other electronic material must be shared beforehand
+ Soft-spoken people are difficult to hear; managers must repeat key messages
+ Frequent communications are helpful (hard to “ overcommunicate ”)
+ Technology challenges
+ Provide technology and support to remote workers
+ Use high quality web conferencing applications
+ Clarify time zones for scheduling
+ Information should be available for everyone (cloud storage can help)
+ Policies and norms about use of the technology can be important
  
Managing the Challenges
+ Diversity challenges
+ Concept of time differs throughout the world
+ Anglo -American cultures view time as a continuum (deadlines are important; many prefer not to multitask)
+ Indian cultures have a cyclical view of time (deadlines are less potent; many prefer to multitask)
+ Team diversity might need nurturing:
+ Communications differences
+ Trust building
+ Group identity formation
  
Gaining Acceptance For It -induced 
Change
+ Many changes might be a major concern for employees
+ Changes might be resisted if they are viewed as negative impacts
+ Several types of resistance:
+ Denying that the system is up and running
+ Sabotage by distorting or otherwise altering inputs
+ Believing and/or spreading the word that the new system will not change the status quo
+ Refusing to use the new system (if voluntary)
