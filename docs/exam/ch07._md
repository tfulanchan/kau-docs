Opening Case
+ What are some important lessons from the opening case?
+ How long did the theft take?

How did the theft likely occur?
+ How long did it take Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to detect the theft?
+ How damaging are the early reports of the data theft for the OPM?

How Long Does it Take?
+ How long do you think it usually takes for someone to discover a security compromise in a system after the evidence shows up?

A.Several seconds
B.Several minutes
C.Several hours
D.Several days
E.Several monthsA Mandiant study revealed 

that the median for  was  days! That ’s almost  months!
The record is , which is years!
 
Timeline of a Breach -Fantasy
+ Hollywood has a fairly consistent script:
+ : Crooks get password and locate the file
+ Minute : Crooks start downloading data and destroying the original
+ Minute : Officials sense the breach
+ Minute : Officials try to block the breach
+ Minute : Crooks ’ download completes
+ Minute : Officials lose all data

How Have Big Breaches Occurred?

Date Detected Company What was stolen How
November  Target  million credit & debit cards Contractor opened 
virus -laden email

May  Ebay #  million user names, physical 
addresses, phones, birth days, 
encrypted passwordsEmployee’s

emails, Social security numbers,

employees

Password Breaches
+ % of breaches are caused by stealing a password.
+ You can steal a password by:
+ Phishing attack
+ Key logger (hardware or software)
+ Guessing weak passwords (  is most common)
+ Evil twin wifi
 
Insecurity of WiFi–a Dutch study
+ “We took a hacker to a café and, in  minutes, he knew where everyone else was born, what schools they attended, and the last five things they googled .”
+ Had WiFi transmitter broadcasting “Starbucks” as ID
+ Because they were connected to him, he scanned for unpatched or vulnerable mobile devices or laptops
+ He also saw passwords and could lock them out of their own accounts.
+ The correspondent: “I will never again be connecting to an insecure public WiFi network without taking security measures .”

Other Approaches
+ Cross -site scripting (malicious code pointing to a link requiring log -in at an imposter site )
+ Third parties
+ Target ’s HVAC system was connected to main systems
+ Contractors had access
+ Hackers gained contractors ’ password
+ Malware captured customer credit card info before it could be encrypted

Cost of Breaches
+ Estimated at $ to $ per stolen record
+ Revenue lost when sales decline
+ Some costs can be recouped by insurance
 
Can You be Safe?
+ No, unless the information is permanently inaccessible
+ “You cannot make a computer secure ” –from Dain Gary, former CERT chief
+ % of all firms have been breached
+ Sometimes security makes systems less usable
 
What Motivates the Hackers?

+ Sell stolen credit card numbers for up to $ each
+  million Target card numbers were sold for $ each on average
+ Street gang members can usually get $ out of a card
+ Some “kits” (card number plus SSN plus medical 
information) sell for up to $,
+ They allow opening new account cards
+ Stolen cards can be sold for bitcoin on the Deep Web

Access Tools

Access Tool Ubiquity Advantages Disadvantages

Physical locks Very high + Excellent if guarded+ Locks can be picked
+ Physical Access is often not needed
+ Keys can be lost

Passwords Very high + User acceptance and familiarity
+ Ease of use
+ Mature practices+ Poor by themselves
+ Sometimes forgotten
+ Sometimes stolen from users using deception or key loggers

Biometrics Medium + Can be reliable
+ Never forgotten
+ Cannot be stolen
+ Can be inexpensive
+ False positives/negatives
+ Some are expensive
+ Some might change (e.g., voice)
+ Lost limbs
+ Loopholes (e.g., photo)
 
Access Tools (continued)

Access Tool Ubiquity Advantages Disadvantages

Challenge questions Medium 
(high in banking)+ Not forgotten
+ Multitude of questions can be used
+ Social networking might reveal some answers
+ Personal knowledge of an individual might reveal the answers
+ Spelling might not be consistent

Token Low 
+ Stolen passkey is useless quickly
+ Requires carrying a device

Text message Medium 
+ Stolen passkey is useless
+ Mobile phone already owned by users
+ Useful as a secondary mechanism too
+ Requires mobile phone ownership by all users
+ Home phone option requires speech synthesis
+ Requires alternative access control if mobile phone lost

Multi -factor authentication Medium
+ Stolen password is useless
+ Enhanced security
+ Requires an additional technique if one of the two fails
+ Temptation for easy password
 
Storage and Transmission Tools

Tool Ubiquity Advantages Disadvantages

Antivirus/anti-spyware Very high 
+ Blocks many known threats
+ Blocks some “zero -day” threats
+ Slow down operating system
+ “Zero day” threats can be missed

Firewall High 
+ Can prevent some targeted traffic
+ Can only filter known threats
+ Can have well -known “holes”

System logs Very high 
+ Can reveal IP address of attacker
+ Can estimate the extent of the breach
+ Hackers can conceal their IP address
+ Hackers can delete logs
+ Logs can be huge
+ Irregular inspections

System alerts High 
+ Can help point to logs
+ Can detect an attack in process
+ High sensitivity
+ Low selectivity
 
Storage and Transmission Tools (continued)

Tool Ubiquity Advantages Disadvantages

Encryption Very high 
+ Difficult to access a file without the key
+ Long keys could take years to break
+ Keys are unnecessary if password is known
+ If the key is not strong, hackers could uncover it by trial and error

WEP/WPA Very high 
+ Same as encryption
+ Most devices have the capability
+ Provides secure wifi connection
+ Same as encryption
+ Some older devices have limited protections
+ WEP is not secure, yet it is still provided

VPN Medium 
+ Trusted connection is as if you were connected on site
+ Hard to decrypt
+ Device could be stolen while connected
+ Sometimes slows the connection
 
Security Policies
+ Perform security updates promptly
+ Separate unrelated networks
+ Keep passwords secret
+ Manage mobile devices (BYOD)
+ Formulate data policies (retention and disposal)
+ Manage social media (rules as to what can be shared, how to identify yourself)
+ Use consultants (Managed Security Services Providers)

SETA (Security Education, Training, and Awareness)
+ Training on access tools
+ Limitations of passwords
+ Formulating a password
+ Changing passwords periodically
+ Using multi -factor authentication
+ Using password managers
 
SETA (Security Education, Training, and Awareness)
+ BYOD
+ Rules
+ How to follow them
+ Social Media
+ Rules
+ How to follow them
+ Cases from the past that created problems

SETA (Security Education, Training, and Awareness)
+ Vigilance: Recognizing:
+ Bogus warning messages
+ Phishing emails
+ Physical intrusions
+ Ports and access channels to examine

Classic Signs of Phishing
+ Account is being closed
+ Email in -box is full
+ Winning a contest or lottery
+ Inheritance or commission to handle funds
+ Product delivery failed
+ Odd URL when hovering
+ Familiar name but strange email address
+ Poor grammar/spelling
+ Impossibly low prices
+ Attachment with EXE, ZIP , or BAT (etc.)
