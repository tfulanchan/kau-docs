Learning Objectives

+ Understand how governance structures define how decisions are made
+ Describe governance based on organization structure, decision rights, and control
+ Discuss examples and strategies for implementation.

Intel’s Transformation
+ Huge performance improvements between 2013 and 2014
+ Was it due to a spending increase?
+ Intel ’s evolution
+  1992: Centralized IT
+  2003: Protect Era –lockdown (SOX & virus)
+  2009: Protect to Enable Era (BYOD pressure)

Intel Reached Level 3:
1. Developing programs and delivering services
2. Contributing business value
3. Transforming the firm

Previously: categorized problems as “business ” or “IT”

Now: Integrated solutions are the only way 

### IT Governance
+ Governance (in business) is all about making decisions that
  + Define expectations , 
  + Grant authority, or 
  + Ensure performance. 
+ Empowerment and monitoring will help align behavior with business goals.
  + Empowerment: granting the right to make decisions.
  + Monitoring: evaluating performance .
+ IT governance focuses on how decision rights can be distributed differently to facilitate three possible modes of decision making:
  + centralized, 
  + decentralized, or 
  + hybrid
+ Organizational structure plays a major role .
 
Four Perspectives
+ Traditional –Centralized vs decentralized
+ Accountability and allocation of decision rights
+ Ecosystem
+ Control structures from legislation
 
Centralized vs. Decentralized Organizational Structures
+ Centralized –bring together all staff, hardware, software, data, and processing into a single location.
+ Decentralized –the components in the centralized structure are scattered in different locations to address local business needs.
+ Federalism –a hybrid of centralized and decentralized structures.
 
Organizational continuum

### Federalism
+ Most companies would like to achieve the advantages of both centralization and decentralization.
+ Leads to federalism
  + Distributes, power,  hardware, software, data and personnel  
  + Between a central IS group and IS in business units
  + A hybrid approach
  + Some decisions centralized; some decentralized

Recent Global Survey
Percent of firms reporting that they are:
+ Centralized: 70.6%
+ Decentralized: 13.5%
+ Federated: 12.7%
 
IT Accountability and Decision Rights Mismatches

|   |   | Accountability |
|-------|----------------|---|---|
|      | | Low | High |
| Decision Rights | High | Technocentric Gap<ul><li>Danger of overspending on IT creating an oversupply</li><li>IT assets may not be utilized to meet business demand</li><li>Business group frustration with IT group</li></ul> | Strategic Norm (Level balance)<ul><li>IT is viewed as competent</li><li>IT is viewed as strategic to business</li></ul> |
|      | Low | Support Norm (Level balance)<ul><li>Works for organizations where IT is viewed as a support function</li><li>Focus is on business efficiency</li></ul> | Business Gap<ul><li>Cost considerations dominate IT decision</li><li>IT assets may not utilize internal competencies to meet business demand</li><li>IT group frustration with business group</li></ul> |

Five major categories of IT decisions.

Political Archetypes (Weill & Ross)
+ Archetypes label the combinations of people who 
either provide information or have key IT decision 
rights
+ Business monarchy, IT monarchy, feudal, federal, IT 
duopoly, and anarchy.
+ Decisions can be made at several levels in the 
organization (Figure .).
+ Enterprise -wide, business unit, and region/group 
within a business unit.
 
Political Archetypes
+ Organizations vary widely in their archetypes 
selected
  + The duopoly is used by the largest portion (36%) of organizations for IT principles decisions.
  + IT monarchy is the most popular for IT architecture (73%) and infrastructure decisions (59%).

Emergent Governance: Digital Ecosystems
+ Challenge a “top down ” approach
+ Self-interested, self -organizing, autonomous sets of technologies from different sources
+ Firms find opportunities to exploit new technologies that were not anticipated
+ Good examples:
  + Google Maps
  + YouTube

Electronic Health Record
+ Can connect to perhaps planned sources:
  + Pharmacy
  + Lab
  + Insurance Company
+ And can connect to unplanned sources:
  + Banks –for payment
  + Tax authority –for matching deductions
  + Smartphone apps –for many purposes

How to govern in this case?
+ Might be difficult to impossible!
+ The systems might simply emerge and evolve over time
+ No one entity can plan these systems in their entirety

Mechanisms for Making Decisions
+ Policies and Standards (60% of firms)
+ Review board or committee
+ Steering committee (or governance council)
  + Key stakeholders
  + Can be at different levels:
    + Higher level (focus on CIO effectiveness)
    + Lower level (focus on details of various projects)
 
### Summary of Three Governance Frameworks
| Governance Framework | Main Concept | Possible Best Practice |
|----------------------|--------------|-------------------------|
| Centralization - Decentralization | Decisions can be made by a central authority or by autonomous individuals or groups in an organization. | A hybrid, Federal approach |
| Decision Archetypes | Specifying patterns based upon allocating decision rights and accountability. | Tailor the archetype to the situation |
| Digital Ecosystems | Members of the ecosystem contribute their strengths, giving the whole ecosystem a complete set of capabilities. | Build flexibility and adaptability into governance. |

A Fourth –Out of a Firm ’s Control: Legislation

Sarbanes -Oxley Act (SoX) (2002)
+ To increase regulatory visibility and accountability of public companies and their financial health
  + All companies subject to the SEC are subject to SoX.
  + + CEOs and CFOs must personally certify and be accountable for their firm’s financial records and accounting.
  + Firms must provide real -time disclosures of any events that may affect a firm’s stock price or financial performance.
  +  year jail term is the alternative.
  + IT departments play a major role in ensuring the accuracy of financial data .

IT Control and Sarbanes -Oxley
+ In 2004 and 2005, IT departments began to 
  + Identify controls
  + Determine design effectiveness
  + Test to validate operation of controls

### IT Control and Sarbanes -Oxley
Five IT control weaknesses are repeatedly uncovered by auditors:
+ Failure to segregate duties within applications, and failure to set up new accounts and terminate old ones in a timely manner
+ Lack of proper oversight for making application changes, including appointing a person to make a change and another to perform quality assurance on it
+ Inadequate review of audit logs to not only ensure that systems were running smoothly but that there also was an audit log of the audit log
+ Failure to identify abnormal transactions in a timely manner
+ Lack of understanding of key system configurations

Frameworks for Implementing SoX
+ Committee of Sponsoring Organzations of the Treadway Commission.
+ Created three control objectives for management and auditors that focused on dealing with risks to internal control
  + Operations –maintain and improve operating effectiveness; protect the firm's assets
  + Compliance –with relevant laws and regulations.
  + Financial reporting –in accordance with GAAP
 
Control Components
Five essential control components were created to make sure a company is meeting its objectives:
+ Control environment (culture of the firm)
+ Assessment of most critical risks to internal controls
+ Control processes that outline important processes and guidelines
+ Communication of those procedures
+ Monitoring of internal controls by management  

Frameworks
+ COBIT (Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology) 
  + IT governance framework that is consistent with COSO controls.
  + Issued in  by Information Systems Audit & Control Association (ISACA)
  + A company must 
    + Determine the processes/risks to be managed.
    + Set up control objectives and KPIs (key performance indicators)
    + Develop activities to reach the KPIs
  + Advantages -well-suited to organizations focused on risk management and mitigation, and very detailed.
  + Disadvantages –costly and time consuming

IS and the Implementation of SoXCompliance
+ The IS department and CIO are involved with the implementation of SoX.
+ Section  deals with management’s assessment of internal controls.
+ Six tactics that CIOs can use in working with auditors, CFOs, and CEOs :
+ Knowledge building (Build a knowledge base)
+ Knowledge deployment (Disseminate knowledge to management.)
+ Innovation directive (Organize for implementing SoX)
+ Mobilization (Persuade players and subsidiaries to cooperate)
+ Standardization (Negotiate agreements, build rules)
+ Subsidy (Fund the costs)
+ A CIO’s ability to employ these various tactics depends upon his/her power (relating to the SoX implementation).
