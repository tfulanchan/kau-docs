industrial product

Core Product: This refers to the fundamental need or problem that the product solves. For instance, a drilling machine's core product is the ability to create holes.

Actual Product: This encompasses the physical attributes of the product, such as its design, features, brand name, and packaging. A drilling machine's actual product might include its power, speed, accuracy, and ergonomic design.

Augmented Product: This level includes additional services and benefits offered beyond the physical product. A drilling machine's augmented product could involve after-sales service, warranty, technical support, and training programs.

organization marketing: Orienting and motivating customer-contact employees and supporting service people to work as a team to provide customer satisfaction

product line

Downward stretching is a product line extension strategy where a company introduces a lower-priced product line to tap into a new market segment.

product mix refers to the total number of product lines a company offers to its customers

Width refers to the total number of product lines a company offers.
A company with a wide product mix offers a diverse range of products, often targeting different market segments.
Example: A company that sells smartphones, tablets, laptops, and smartwatches has a wide product mix.

Length refers to the total number of products within a product line.
A company with a long product mix offers many variations within each product line, catering to specific customer preferences.
Example: A smartphone company that offers different models with varying storage capacities, screen sizes, and camera resolutions has a long product mix.

Depth refers to the number of variations within a single product line.
A company with a deep product mix offers a wide range of options within each product category.
Example: A clothing retailer that offers different colors, sizes, and styles within a particular clothing line has a deep product mix.

Consistency refers to how closely related the various product lines are to each other in terms of use, production, distribution, or target market.
A consistent product mix allows for efficient marketing and distribution strategies.

service characteristic

Intangibility: Services cannot be seen, touched, tasted, smelled, or owned like physical products.
This makes it difficult for customers to evaluate services before consumption.
Example: A haircut or a consulting service.

Inseparability: Production and consumption of services often occur simultaneously.
The quality of the service is influenced by the interaction between the service provider and the customer.
Example: A restaurant meal or a doctor's consultation.

Variability: The quality of services can vary depending on who provides them, when they are provided, and where they are provided.
This variability can lead to inconsistencies in service delivery.
Example: A hotel room cleaning service can vary between different staff members or different shifts.

Perishability: Services cannot be stored for future use.
If a service is not consumed when it is offered, it is lost forever.
Example: An airline seat that is not sold for a specific flight cannot be sold later.
