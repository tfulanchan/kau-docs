# [MRKT-260 Principles of Marketing](https://www.kau.edu.sa/Files/0013274/Subjects/Syllabus_MRKT260.pdf)

The **Production Concept**: It holds that consumers will prefer products that are widely available and inexpensive. Assume that consumers are primarily interested in product availability and low prices. This orientation makes sense in developing countries, where consumers are more interested in obtaining the product than in its features.

The **Product Concept**: This orientation holds that consumers will favor those products that offer the most quality, performance, or innovative features. Assume that buyers admire well-made products and can appraise quality and performance. Management might commit the “better-mousetrap” fallacy, believing that a better mousetrap will lead people to beat a path to its door. 
 
The **Selling Concept**: It holds that consumers and businesses, if left alone, will ordinarily not buy enough of the selling company’s products. The organization must, therefore, undertake an aggressive selling and promotion effort. Assumes that consumers typically must be coaxed into buying. It also assumes that the company has a whole battery of effective selling and promotional tools to stimulate more buying. Most firms practice the selling concept when they have overcapacity.  Their aim is to sell what they make rather than make what the market wants.

The **Marketing Concept**: This is a business philosophy that challenges the above three business orientations. Its central tenets crystallized in the 1950s. It holds that the key to achieving its organizational goals (goals of the selling company) consists of the company being more effective than competitors in creating, delivering, and communicating customer value to its selected target customers. The marketing concept rests on four pillars:  target market, customer needs, integrated marketing and profitability.

A [harvest strategy](https://www.wallstreetmojo.com/harvest-strategy/) is a business approach to extract maximum profit from a product shortly before discontinuing it. This strategic maneuver optimizes short-term gains, eliminates resource-draining elements, and generates cash flow to support new ventures.

**Market penetration** is a measure of how much a product or service is being used by target customers compared to the total estimated market for that product or service.

**Market development** is a growth strategy that identifies and develops new market segments for current products. It involves marketing existing products in new markets.

**Vertical integration** is a business strategy to take ownership of two or more key stages of its operations to cut costs.

A **value chain** refers to the full lifecycle of a product or process, including material sourcing, production, consumption and disposal/recycling processes.

**Product positioning** is a strategic exercise that defines where your product or service fits in the marketplace and why it is better than alternative solutions.

**Market segmentation** is the practice of dividing your target market into approachable groups.

A **business market** is a market in which organisations sell their goods and services to other organisations to use in their manufacturing process or service provision.

[Break bulk](https://dhl-freight-connections.com/en/logistics-dictionary/break-bulk/) is the system of transporting goods in pieces separately, rather than being shipped in a container. Goods shipped in crates, bags, boxes, drums, barrels without the use of container are referred to as break bulk cargoes. These type of cargoes are usually large in sizes and dimensions.

Business aims are the results that a company strives to achieve, whilst marketing objectives get down to the specifics on how your efforts can impact the business' wider goals.

**Positioning** is determining the distinctive place you want your product to occupy. **Differentiation** is designing your product offering so that it has one or more unique qualities valued by the customer. A value proposition is any answer to the question of why should the customer buy your product.

Value-based pricing is a business strategy that primarily relies on customers' perceived value of goods or services to determine cost.

Societal Marketing focuses on social responsibilities and recommends maintaining long-term success.
